Subject: [PATCH 0/7] tests: use skip_all=* to skip tests
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Here's another series that changes the skip_all=* usage to prereq
skipping. I didn't do all the tests that use skip_all=*, but this is a
large chunk of them.

The motivation is to improve our test metrics. I want to get
statistics from the smokers about how many tests are being skipped on
each platform/OS.

This is arranged in one commit per patch for ease of reviewing. It
only contains the following changes:

  * Change skip_all=* && test_done -> test_set_prereq, then use that
    prereq with test_expect_success.

  * Setup work for subsequents tests has been moved to tests. This
    avoids work on platforms where we aren't running the rest of the
    test, and catches edge cases where the setup work fails for some
    reason.
