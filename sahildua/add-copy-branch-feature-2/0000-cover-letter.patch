Now that bw/config-h has landed in master here's a version that's
rebased on that. No changes from v1 except:

 - moving the new config header addition from cache.h to config.h,
   corresponding to what was done in bw/config-h.

 - fixing a trivial comment whitespace issue which I see you applied
   locally.

Even though this modifies some of the same files as
mh/packed-ref-store it looks to me like this doesn't conflict with
that topic in any meaningful way, but I may be missing something. I
can't get a merge between this & gitster/mh/packed-ref-store
compiling, but that's due to issues in the latter which seem to be
fixed by some subsequent merge/fixup in pu, not something to do with a
genuine conflict with this topic.

Hopefully this'll allow this topic to land in 2.14.
