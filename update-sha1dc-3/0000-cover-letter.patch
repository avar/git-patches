Subject: [PATCH 0/3] Update sha1dc from upstream & optionally make it a submodule

This series:

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (3):
  sha1dc: update from upstream
   
   * Fixes the Big-Endian detection on Solaris SPARC (and probably
     others) which broke the build as of 2.13.0 due to sha1dc being the
     dauflt.
   
   * Includes a patch from upstream fixing unaligned access, which broke
     SPARC even more. This replaces Junio's "[PATCH] sha1dc: fix issues
     with a big endian platform"
     (<xmqq37c4xcr6.fsf_-_@gitster.mtv.corp.google.com>) with something
     which brings in upstream as-is.
   
   * Most importantly: Uses upstream code as-is with no modifications,
     which is possible due to a pull request I sent them.

   * This patch can be picked stand-alone without [23]/3.

  sha1dc: use sha1collisiondetection as a submodule

   * Since we can now use upstream code as-is let's use it as a
     submodule.
   
     Yes there are still (solvable) UX issues with submodules, but
     there's no project better equipped to deal with them than
     git.git.

  sha1dc: remove the unused sha1dc/ directory

   * Sent as a separate patch for readability. Can be squashed into
     2/3.
