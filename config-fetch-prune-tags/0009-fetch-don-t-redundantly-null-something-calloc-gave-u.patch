Subject: [PATCH 09/11] fetch: don't redundantly null something calloc() gave
 us
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Stop redundantly NULL-ing the last element of the refs structure,
which was retrieved via calloc() and is thus guaranteed to be
pre-NULL'd.

This code dates back to b888d61c83 ("Make fetch a builtin",
2007-09-10), where wasn't any reason to do this back then either, it's
just something left over from when git-fetch was initially introduced.

The initial motivation for this change was to make a subsequent change
which'll also modify the refs variable smaller, since it won't have to
copy this redundant "NULL the last + 1 item" pattern.
