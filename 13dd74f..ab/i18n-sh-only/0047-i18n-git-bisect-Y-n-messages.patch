Subject: [PATCH v2 47/48] i18n: git-bisect [Y/n] messages
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Gettextize the [Y/n] questions git-bisect presents, and leave a note
in a TRANSLATORS comment explaining that translators have to preserve
a mention of the Y/n characters since the program will expect them,
and not their localized equivalents.
