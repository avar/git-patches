Subject: [PATCH 0/3] hash-object doc: small fixes
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Small doc fixes. Maybe trivial enough to land in 2.22, but there's no
rush.

A pair of #leftoverbits I noticed is that we've implemented the
"--stdin-paths" option via unquote_c_style() from day one, so our
current docs lie (and still do with this series) about wanting
\n-delimited files, you can't hash a file called '"foo"' as you'd
expect, you need to pass '"\"foo\""'.

I wonder if we should document this at this point, or just change it
and add a "-z" option. None of our tests fail if I remove this
unquote_c_style() codepath, and it's never been documented, but
someone in the wild may have organically depended on it.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (3):
  hash-object doc: stop mentioning git-cvsimport
  hash-object doc: elaborate on -w and --literally promises
  hash-object doc: point to ls-files and rev-parse
