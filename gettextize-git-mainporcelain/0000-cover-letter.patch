Subject: [PATCH/RFC 00/17] Begin gettextizing Git
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Now that Git has the infrastructure for translation in next I'm going
to start submitting patches to make the main porcelain translatable.

This series starts that work, and fixes and also fixes up some of the
infrastructure (like the bug discussed in "Odd encoding issue with
UTF-8 + gettext yields ? on non-ASCII"), and adds tests to make sure
it's all working.

With it applied git-init is the one and only utility of the porcelain
that's translatable. The series includes a translation of it into
Icelandic and Polish.

I think it's ready to be applied. I tested it on Solaris, FreeBSD and
Debian. But there's almost definitely something I'm missing in a
series this big, so it's an RFC.

  po/pl.po: add Polish translation
