Subject: [RFC PATCH v2 0/2] suppress trailing whitespace on empty "notes" lines
MIME-Version: 1.0

This is a review of Eric Sunshin's
<20210830072118.91921-1-sunshine@sunshineco.com> series.

Side note:

    I'm generally trying to see if just sending a "proposed vX" is
    more productive for everyone than patch feedback effectively
    describing it in prose. I don't mean for this thing to be picked
    up as-is by Junio without the consent of the submitter, and don't
    have any desire to "pick up" the series myself.

    My review workflow is just applying the patches locally, fiddling
    with them, so it seems like the most straightforward and helpful
    thing to send the result of that local end-state, rather than
    describing the changes I made in prose, and expect the original
    submitter to reverse engineer that state if they're interested in
    trying it out locally themselves.

I really like the end goal of
<20210830072118.91921-1-sunshine@sunshineco.com> series, but this
seems like a more straightforward way to get to that goal.

I.e. the original 1/3 and 2/3 starts out by making the tests
whitespace-independent. If we just skip that 1/3, and then in 3/3
tweak the relevant failing tests for the code change we won't even
need a new test, all the existing tests previously made
whitespace-independent in 1/3 will assert this new behavior.
