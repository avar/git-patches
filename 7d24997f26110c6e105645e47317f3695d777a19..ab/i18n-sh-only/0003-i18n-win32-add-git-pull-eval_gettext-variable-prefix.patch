Subject: [PATCH 3/6] i18n win32: add git-pull eval_gettext variable prefix
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Change the eval_gettext() invocations to use the GIT_I18N_VARIABLE_
prefix for variables used in eval_gettext. On Windows environment
variables are case insensitive, so e.g. $PATH clashes with $path. By
using a sufficiently unique prefix we work around that issue.
