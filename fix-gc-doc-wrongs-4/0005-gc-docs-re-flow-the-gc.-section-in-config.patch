Subject: [PATCH v4 05/11] gc docs: re-flow the "gc.*" section in "config"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Re-flow the "gc.*" section in "config". A previous commit moved this
over from the "gc" docs, but tried to keep as many of the lines
identical to benefit from diff's move detection.
