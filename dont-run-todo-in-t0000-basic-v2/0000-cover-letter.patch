The problem is that you have to modify *all* the outer wrappers. Since
the test suite can be run with any TAP consumer that isn't viable, and
at the very least having to do:

    prove --source=Some::Custom::Git Thing ...

Is tedious, and requires us to maintain the Some::Custom::Git thingy.

Anyway, here's a better patch. It allows us to run a pasing TODO test,
check if it works, and if so not mark *that* test as passing TODO, but
simply as passing.

As a side benefit it makes the test lib more awesome.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (4):
  test-lib: Use $TEST_DIRECTORY or $GIT_BUILD_DIR instead of $(pwd) and
    ../
  test-lib: Use "$GIT_BUILD_DIR" instead of "$TEST_DIRECTORY"/../
  test-lib: Allow overriding of TEST_DIRECTORY
  t/t0000-basic.sh: Run the passing TODO test inside its own test-lib
