         pack-objects.c: do stdin parsing via revision.c's API
     
    -    Extend the rev_info stdin parsing API to support hooking into its
    -    read_revisions_from_stdin() function, and change the custom stdin
    -    parsing in pack-objects.c to use it.
    +    Use the new "handle_stdin_line" API in revision.c to parse stdin in
    +    pack-objects.c, instead of using custom pack-objects.c-specific code
    +    to do so.
    +
    +    This means that we can remove the "if (len && line[len - 1] == '\n')"
    +    check, it's now redundant to using strbuf_getline(), and we get to
    +    skip the whole "warn_on_object_refname_ambiguity" dance. The
    +    read_revisions_from_stdin() function in revision.c we're now using
    +    does it for us.
     
         The pack-objects.c code being refactored away here was first added in
