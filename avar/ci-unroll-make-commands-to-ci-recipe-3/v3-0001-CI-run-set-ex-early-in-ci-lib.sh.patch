Subject: [PATCH v3 01/29] CI: run "set -ex" early in ci/lib.sh
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Change ci/lib.sh to run "set -ex" before it does anything else, before
this we were omitting a few "export" commands in our trace output that
happened before we enabled tracing.
