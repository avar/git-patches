Subject: [PATCH 0/7] object.c: add and use "is expected" utility function + object_as_type() use
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This goes on top of [1] and is part of a split-up [2] into more
digestable pieces.

As in [2] we reduce duplication of "object %s is a %s not a %s" in
various places by moving those messages/errors/dies to using a utility
function.

For the more meaty "don't misreport objects" change I'm planning to
submit on top of this I'm then refactoring object_as_type() to not
take a "quiet" argument. This wasn't strictly needed, but makes things
simpler.

As it turned out we had various parts of the codebase (ab)using
object_as_type() just to check if something was of a given type,
anything that deals with parsed objects can/should just use obj->type
== OBJ_{COMMIT,TREE,BLOB,TAG} instead. This leaves object_as_type() as
a low-level function for use in the object API itself.
