Perhaps this follow-up to 832ec72c3e1 (Merge branch 'ab/run-command',
2021-12-15) will warm Jeff's heart if/when he returns from his git
sabbatical :)

Junio: We're in the RC period, but perhaps this change if we're ever
going to make it would be good to make around that time of patch
slowdown. I.e. for the first batch after release.

I've been holding onto this since around December, but when I checked
there was always 1-2 series that was adding new use of "env_array",
resolving that conflict didn't seem worth the hassle.

Right now this doesn't conflict with anything in "seen". The
scary-at-first diffstat is almost entirely in 2/3, and everything
except a two-line change in that commit is made by the coccinelle rule
added in 1/3.

So this series for reviewing is really:

 * A trivial coccinelle rule in 1/3
 * The trivial 2 line change in run-command.h in 2/3 that isn't made
   by that rule
 * Subsequent trivial cleanup in 3/3 changing s/env_array/env/g in
   comments & variable names

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (3):
  cocci: add a rename of "struct child_process"'s "env_array" to "env"
  run-command API: rename "env_array" to "env"
  run-command API users: use "env" not "env_array" in comments & names
