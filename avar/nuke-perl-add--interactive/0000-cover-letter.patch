Subject: [PATCH 0/3] add: remove Perl version of "git add -[pi]"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The v2.37.0 we've made the built-in version of "git add -i" and "git
add -p" the default, after having had the built-in version optionally
available since v2.25.0.

With this the time we kept around the legacy implementation falls
between the time we kept the similar "rebase" and "stash"
implementations.

After it was made the default we had a next-release regression fix[1],
but haven't had any issues since then. Any outstanding bugs in it are
something we'd fix in the C code, not something where users are likely
to want an escape hatch to scramble back to the Perl implementation.

Branch & CI for this available at:
https://github.com/avar/git/tree/avar/nuke-perl-add--interactive

1. 4788e8b2569 (add --interactive: allow `update` to stage deleted
   files, 2022-06-28)
