Subject: [PATCH 0/2] parse-options.[ch]: enum fixup & enum nit
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This tiny series fixes an issue new in v2.34.0-rc* where a recent
patch of mine incorrectly changed a return type to an enum that wasn't
applicable to that function. That fix is in 1/2. Thanks to SZEDER for
spotting it!

Junio: As noted in [1] I don't think this needs to be integrated
before the release, but if you wanted to pick it up anyway I think
it's safe. Maybe someone's compiler will complain about the pre-image.

2/2 then marks a static function I missed with an enum, which it was
already always returning except in an error case.

  parse-options.[ch]: revert use of "enum" for parse_options()
  parse-options.c: use "enum parse_opt_result" for parse_nodash_opt()
