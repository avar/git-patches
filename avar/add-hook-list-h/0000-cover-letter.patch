Subject: [PATCH 0/3] Add a generated list of hooks in hook-list.h
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This goes on top of my just-submitted trivial Makefile fixes[1], and
adds a list of hooks in hook-list.h, similar to the existing
config-list.h.

We can then error when a C API provides us with an unknown hook, so
non-type-checked things in the codebase like find_hook("proc-receive")
now effectively have a type check of sorts (well, we'd catch a typo in
our tests).

These changes are currently at the end of the
ab/config-based-hooks-base series[2], I'm carving them out to make
that topic even easier to digest. We can this without any of the "git
hook run" stuff.

We also had a big but inaccurate list of hooks in builtin/help.c, as
part of submitting a bugreport. That's now using githooks(5) as a
source of truth.

This also builds on Windows with cmake, unlike the outstanding [2]
`restart of "config-based-hooks"` series, at least that part of the CI
now passes, and the change to contrib/buildsystems/CMakeLists.txt
looks trivially correct to me.

  hook.c: add a hook_exists() wrapper and use it in bugreport.c

  hook.[ch]: move find_hook() to this new library
  hook-list.h: add a generated list of hooks, like config-list.h
