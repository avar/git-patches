Subject: [PATCH 0/2] diff_free(): free a bit more, fix leaks
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

A short and simple two-part series to fix some leaks in after
diff_flush() and friends are called by making in diff_free() more
useful.

This series along with other small leak fixes I have outstanding
on-list now is the last step I have before the big one of submitting a
series to fix the "big one" across the test suite: the common leaks in
the revisions API.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (2):
  diff.[ch]: have diff_free() call clear_pathspec(opts.pathspec)
  diff.[ch]: have diff_free() free options->parseopts
