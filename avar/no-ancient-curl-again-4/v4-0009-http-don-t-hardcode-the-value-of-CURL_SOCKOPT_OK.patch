Subject: [PATCH v4 9/9] http: don't hardcode the value of CURL_SOCKOPT_OK
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Use the new git-curl-compat.h header to define CURL_SOCKOPT_OK to its
known value if we're on an older curl version that doesn't have it. It
was hardcoded in http.c in a15d069a198 (http: enable keepalive on TCP
sockets, 2013-10-12).
