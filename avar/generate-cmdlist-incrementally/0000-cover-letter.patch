Subject: [PATCH 0/8] Makefile: make command-list.h 2-5x as fast with -jN
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This series is based off an off-hand comment I made about making the
cmdlist.sh faster, in the meantime much of the same methods are
already cooking in "next" for the "lint-docs" target.

See 7/8 for the main performance numbers, along the way I stole some
patches from Johannes Sixt who'd worked on optimizing the script
before, which compliment this new method of generating this file by
piggy-backing more on GNU make for managing a dependency graph for us.

Johannes Sixt (2):
  generate-cmdlist.sh: spawn fewer processes
  generate-cmdlist.sh: replace for loop by printf's auto-repeat feature

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (6):
  command-list.txt: sort with "LC_ALL=C sort"
  generate-cmdlist.sh: trivial whitespace change
  generate-cmdlist.sh: don't call get_categories() from category_list()
  generate-cmdlist.sh: run "grep | sort", not "sort | grep"
  Makefile: stop having command-list.h depend on a wildcard
  Makefile: assert correct generate-cmdlist.sh output
