Subject: [PATCH v2 0/3] SubmittingPatches: a few unrelated minor fixes
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

A few minor updates to SubmittingPatches spotted while paging through
it the other day (or other month, given the delay until v2).

See
https://lore.kernel.org/git/cover-0.3-0000000000-20210512T084137Z-avarab@gmail.com/
for the v1 discussion. This hopefully addresses all the outstanding
comments with it.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (3):
  SubmittingPatches: move discussion of Signed-off-by above "send"
  SubmittingPatches: replace discussion of Travis with GitHub Actions
  SubmittingPatches: remove pine-specific hints from MUA hints
