Subject: [PATCH 1/3] SubmittingPatches: move discussion of Signed-off-by above
 "send"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Move the section discussing the addition of a SOB trailer above the
section that discusses generating the patch itself. This makes sense
as we don't want someone to go through the process of "git
format-patch", only to realize late that they should have used "git
commit -s" or equivalent.

This is a move-only change, no lines here are are being altered, only
moved around.

+=== Certify your work by adding your `Signed-off-by` trailer
+

+wrote the patch or have the right to pass it on under the same license
+as ours, by "signing off" your patch.  Without sign-off, we cannot
+accept your patches.

+a. The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
+   have the right to submit it under the open source license
+   indicated in the file; or
+
+b. The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
+   of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
+   license and I have the right under that license to submit that
+   work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
+   by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
+   permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
+   in the file; or
+
+c. The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
+   person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
+   it.

+D-C-O.  Indeed you are encouraged to do so.  Do not forget to
+place an in-body "From: " line at the beginning to properly attribute
+the change to its true author (see (2) above).
+
+This procedure originally came from the Linux kernel project, so our
+rule is quite similar to theirs, but what exactly it means to sign-off
+your patch differs from project to project, so it may be different
+from that of the project you are accustomed to.

+If you like, you can put extra tags at the end:

+. `Reported-by:` is used to credit someone who found the bug that
+  the patch attempts to fix.
+. `Acked-by:` says that the person who is more familiar with the area
+  the patch attempts to modify liked the patch.
+. `Reviewed-by:`, unlike the other tags, can only be offered by the
+  reviewer and means that she is completely satisfied that the patch
+  is ready for application.  It is usually offered only after a
+  detailed review.
+. `Tested-by:` is used to indicate that the person applied the patch
+  and found it to have the desired effect.
+
+You can also create your own tag or use one that's in common usage
+such as "Thanks-to:", "Based-on-patch-by:", or "Mentored-by:".
