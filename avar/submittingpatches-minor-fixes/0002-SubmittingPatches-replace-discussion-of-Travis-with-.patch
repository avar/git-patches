Subject: [PATCH 2/3] SubmittingPatches: replace discussion of Travis with
 GitHub Actions
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Replace the discussion of Travis CI added in
0e5d028a7a0 (Documentation: add setup instructions for Travis CI,
2016-05-02) with something that covers the GitHub Actions added in
889cacb6897 (ci: configure GitHub Actions for CI/PR, 2020-04-11).

The setup is trivial compared to using Travis, and it even works on
Windows (that "hopefully soon" comment was probably out-of-date on
Travis as well).
