Subject: [PATCH v2 0/2] pack-objects: missing tests & --stdin-packs segfault fix
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

When re-rolling an unrelated series[1] dealing with pack-objects.c and
revision.c I discovered that we have some test blindspots, and that
the newly added --stdin-packs option in v2.32.0 will segfault if fed
garbage data.

See
http://lore.kernel.org/git/cover-0.2-00000000000-20210621T145819Z-avarab@gmail.com
for the v1 of this series.

This hopefully addresses Taylor's comments in
https://lore.kernel.org/git/YND3h2l10PlnSNGJ@nand.local/

I didn't end up moving away from the "<in" pattern. I prefer it
because it makes manual inspection easier, and the tests above this
one used it consistently, so I left it in place.

I also ended up keeping the test_cmp for the reasons noted in the
updated 2/2 commit message. I.e. if we're commeting on this tricky
edge case let's have our tests assert that the code works that way,
and that the comment still holds.

         The logic error was in assuming that we could iterate all packs and
