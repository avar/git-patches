Subject: [PATCH 0/2] hook tests: pre-push test style & test accurace
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

A trivial topic to fix a blind spot in the test coverage for pre-push
hooks, and to fix miscellaneous issues in that test while we're at it.

These patches have been on-list before as part of a much bigger topic
submission. I opted to split these out to make the continuation of
these larger hook topics easier to digest.

The last iteration was at [1] and [2]. As the range-diff to those
patches below shows there's been no change since then.

  hook tests: test for exact "pre-push" hook input
  hook tests: use a modern style for "pre-push" tests
