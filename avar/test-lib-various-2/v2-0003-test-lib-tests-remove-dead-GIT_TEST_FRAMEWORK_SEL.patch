Subject: [PATCH v2 03/12] test-lib tests: remove dead
 GIT_TEST_FRAMEWORK_SELFTEST variable
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Stop setting the GIT_TEST_FRAMEWORK_SELFTEST variable. This was originally needed
back in 4231d1ba99 (t0000: do not get self-test disrupted by
environment warnings, 2018-09-20).

It hasn't been needed since I deleted the relevant code in test-lib.sh
in c0eedbc009 (test-lib: remove check_var_migration, 2021-02-09), I
just didn't notice that it was set here.
