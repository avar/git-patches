Subject: [RFC PATCH 0/8] Get rid of "git --super-prefix"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

An RFC alternative to Glen's [1], and what I *thought* he might be be
going for in the earlier discussion[2].

The difference is that in Glen's there's no "git --super-prefix", but
rather each set of commands still using it ("submodule--helper",
"read-tree" etc.) geit their own command-level option.

But it still works substantially the same, in that we're juggling a
global variable that we set, and read out later somewhere down the
stack.

Whereas here there's no renaming of the option, but:

 * For "submodule--helper" only the sub-commands that need it take the
   option, it's not an option to "submodule--helper" itself.

 * There's no passing of the "super_prefix" as a global, instead we
   pass it all the way along until we recurse to ourselves. For
   "submodule--helper" this is quite straightforward.

 * Then in 8/8 we're left with just "read-tree" needing the remaining
   "--super-prefix", and we likewise don't pass it as a global, but
   instead add it to the "struct unpack_trees_options", which will
   pass it all the way down into unpack-trees.c and entry.c, until
   we're going to recursively invoke another "read-tree".

This is on top of my "ab/submodule-helper-prep-only" which is now in
"next", and can make use of (but doesn't need) the better test
coverage for "absorbgitdirs" that I submitted in [3].

A non-RFC version of this should really steal Glen's tests, in
particular the "partial clone" one from [4]. That test passes with
this series.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (8):
  submodule--helper: don't use global --super-prefix in "absorbgitdirs"
  submodule--helper: "deinit" has never used "--super-prefix"
  submodule--helper: convert "foreach" to its own "--super-prefix"
  submodule--helper: convert "sync" to its own "--super-prefix"
  submodule--helper: convert "status" to its own "--super-prefix"
  submodule--helper: convert "{update,clone}" to their own
    "--super-prefix"
  submodule tests: test "git branch -t" output and stderr
  read-tree: add "--super-prefix" option, eliminate global
