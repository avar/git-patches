Subject: [PATCH 0/3] pager: test for exit behavior & trace2 bug fix
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

While reading the pager code I discovered[1] that we log the wrong
exit code when the pager itself exits with non-zero under trace2. This
fixes that bug.

I think whatever the consensus is on the SIGPIPE exit status
propagating it makes sense if we'd ignore it to rebase the patch to do
so[1] on this. I think the addition of a new "test-tool pager" there
is redundant to testing SIGHUP from git itself as 1/3 does here, but
maybe I'm missing something...

2/3 is not needed for the end-state here, but I figured it was a good
refactoring while I was at it.

  pager: test for exit code
  pager: refactor wait_for_pager() function
  pager: properly log pager exit code when signalled
