Subject: [PATCH v4 0/6] tests: fix ignored & hidden exit codes
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Various fixes for "git" on the LHS of a pipe, but mostly when in
"test" expressions like:

	test str = "$(git some-command)" &&

Changes since v3[1]:

 * The previous 1/8 and 3/8 were picked independently, and have landed
   on "master". I was waiting for those to graduate before a re-roll.
 * Add a missing test_expect_success to 1/6, as pointed out by René
   (thanks!).
 * Remove commit message mention of the now-dead test_cmp_cmd (thanks
   Eric!)
 * Reword commit messages, fix typos etc. (thanks Junio, and other
   reviewers!)

I think this should address all of the feedback on the v3, except
Junio's suggestion of perhaps re-arranging this series around file
boundaries.

Given the potential size of that range-diff I thought it was better to
mosttly keep the same structure.

         SANITIZE=leak, this code doesn't leak now as far as I can tell, but I
