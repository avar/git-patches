Subject: [PATCH v2 00/10] send-email: various optimizations to speed up by >2x
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

A re-roll of [1], the work I based v1 on top of has landed in master,
so this has been rebased on master.

The changes here are minor, just a typo fix / commit message
clarification, moving "require" closer to where it's used, and finally
a new 10/10 patch to s/cwd/getcwd/g.

As noted in the commit message I don't think that'll make any
difference in practice. The "time" Eric posted was for loading Cwd.pm
and then doing cwd() or getcwd(), but when we run it we've already
paid the cost of loading Cwd.pm. But it was an easy change to make, so
let's make it anyway.
