Subject: [PATCH v2 0/2] svn tests: trivial "set -e" in main body of test fixes
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

As noted in 1. this set of trivial fixes has been split off from my
"describe tests fixes. The two patches were needed for a now-ejected
"make test_expect_{success,failure} return 1" (to catch such "set -e"
issues).

Even with that gone for now and thus the immediate incentive for these
fixes being gone, it makes sense to fix these tests to use a more
modern style.

The only other change since v1 is using ">" instead of "touch" per
Eric Wong's suggestion, and rewording the commit message(s) to not
promise a follow-up change to test_expect_{success,failure}.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (2):
  svn tests: remove legacy re-setup from init-clone test
  svn tests: refactor away a "set -e" in test body

         svn tests: refactor away a "set -e" in test body
     
         Refactor a test added in 83c9433e67 (git-svn: support for git-svn
    -    propset, 2014-12-07) to avoid using "set -e" in the test body. This
    -    would have broken in combination with a subsequent change to make
    -    "test_expect_success" return 1 to catch such cases.
    +    propset, 2014-12-07) to avoid using "set -e" in the test body. Let's
    +    move this into a setup test using "test_expect_success" instead.
     
    -    While I'm at it rewrite the test to conform to a modern style in our
    -    tests, using the "test_when_finished" function for the "rm -rf", and
    -    avoiding repeated "mkdir" in favor of "mkdir -p".
    +    While I'm at it refactor:
    +
    +     * Repeated "mkdir" to "mkdir -p"
    +     * Uses of "touch" to creating the files with ">" instead
    +     * The "rm -rf" at the end to happen in a "test_when_finished"
