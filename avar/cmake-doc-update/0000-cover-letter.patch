Subject: [PATCH 0/2] cmake doc: modernize and cross-platform-ize the docs
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Change the cmake docs to use one-command build instructions using
options that "cmake" supports an ill our supported versions, and in
2/2 re-arrange the docs to make it clearer which part of the
instructions are platform-specific.

Like the just-submitted [1] this extracted from [2], and the range
diff below is to [2]. The only change since [2] is a trivial reflow
change in the commit message.

There were no outstanding issues or feedback with this part of [2], so
hopefully this can advance relatively quickly.
