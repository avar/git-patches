Subject: [PATCH 0/5] cocci: make "incremental" possible + a ccache-like tool
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This series makes the "coccicheck" rule incremental by only re-running
"spatch" for those file/rule combinations that changed.

The result is that e.g. running "make coccicheck" followed by a:

	make -W grep.c coccicheck

Will take around 2s instead of a *lot* longer. The 3/5 change has all
the details about this, and why it's safe.

I had a previous stab at trying to make "coccicheck" faster a while
ago in [1], but that was fatally flawed because it would break in
cases where grep.c e.g. dependen on a header that changed.

This series doesn't suffer from that issue, because we piggy-back on
the corresponding .depend/* files to extract dependency info. This
does mean that the incremental speed-ups depend on
COMPUTE_HEADER_DEPENDENCIES=yes (which is the case with "gcc" and
"clang" by default).

I've been running with this series locally for a while. I think it
should fully solve the lamentations about the coccicheck being too
slow (e.g. in [2]), particularly when paired with the new
"spatchcache" helper added in 5/5.

Even without that helper running "make coccicheck" e.g. after applying
a patch series now becomes viable, provided the patches don't modify
one of the "rebuild everything" files we have (such as cache.h and
git-compat-util.h).
