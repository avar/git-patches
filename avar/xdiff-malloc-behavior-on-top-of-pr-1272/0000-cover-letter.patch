Subject: [PATCH 0/7] xdiff: use standard alloc macros, share them via git-shared-util.h
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This series is on top of
https://lore.kernel.org/git/pull.1272.git.1656516334.gitgitgadget@gmail.com/;
and shows that we can factor our the allocation macros used in cache.h
and git-compat-util.h instead of defining replacements for them and
alloc_nr() in xdiff/*.

The journy towards doing so is slightly longer, but I think worth
doing, since...

I think part of what I was claiming upthread I was just confused
about. I.e. yes we do use xdl_malloc() defined as xmalloc() already,
what *is* true (and I didn't make this clear) was that your proposed
series cements that further in place.

But as 6/7 here notes 36c83197249 (xdiff: use xmalloc/xrealloc,
2019-04-11) left us with that state of affairs for expediency, but as
we're really close to just "properly lib-ifying" xdiff I think we
should just do that. At the time of 36c83197249 we had ~20 calls to
xdl_malloc(), after your series we were at ~1/2 of that (including a
callers that 36c83197249 explicitly punted on).

This larger series is something we can do later, but I'm submitting it
as a non-RFC in case there's consensus to pick it up on top. The sum
of the two would be smaller if they were squashed together, but I
haven't done that here.

The 1/7 is an amendmend I suggested to 47be28e51e6 (Merge branch
'pw/xdiff-alloc-fail', 2022-03-09), since it was modifying some of the
same lines of code...

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (7):
  xdiff: simplify freeing patterns around xdl_free_env()
  git-shared-util.h: move "shared" allocation utilities here
  git-shared-util.h: add G*() versions of *ALLOC_*()
  xdiff: use G[C]ALLOC_ARRAY(), not XDL_CALLOC_ARRAY()
  xdiff: use GALLOC_GROW(), not XDL_ALLOC_GROW()
  xdiff: remove xdl_malloc() wrapper, use malloc(), not xmalloc()
  xdiff: remove xdl_free(), use free() instead
