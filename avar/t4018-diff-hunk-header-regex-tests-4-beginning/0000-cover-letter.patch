Subject: [PATCH v4 00/10] userdiff: refactor + test improvements
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This is a restart of the 35-patch v3 of this topic at
https://lore.kernel.org/git/20210224195129.4004-1-avarab@gmail.com/

I still plan on submitting the rest of it, but wanted to start with
the early parts of that series that hasn't been controversial or has
outstanding feedback I haven't addressed.

The range-diff to v3 is just for those patches I'm re-rolling here.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (10):
  userdiff: refactor away the parse_bool() function
  userdiff style: re-order drivers in alphabetical order
  userdiff style: declare patterns with consistent style
  userdiff style: normalize pascal regex declaration
  userdiff: add and use for_each_userdiff_driver()
  userdiff tests: explicitly test "default" pattern
  userdiff tests: list builtin drivers via test-tool
  userdiff: remove support for "broken" tests
  blame tests: don't rely on t/t4018/ directory
  blame tests: simplify userdiff driver test
