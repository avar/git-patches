Subject: [PATCH 0/5] refs: designated init & missing debug in ps/fetch-mirror-optim
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

When I recently submitted a topic[1] to convert various things to
designated initializers Junio (presumably) ejected the refs changes
due to conflicts with ps/fetch-mirror-optim. The rest of the series
was down already in 20d34c07ea4 (Merge branch
'ab/c99-designated-initializers', 2022-03-06)

Now that that series has landed 1-3/5 are those previous patches
re-submitted (with a minor change for the new "read_symbolic_ref").

The 4/5 is then a deletion of packed-backend.c stub functions that I
think are not worth carrying anymore, and which has the fringe benefit
of squashing a noisy warning under SunCC.

5/5 is then a minor fix-up for ps/fetch-mirror-optim: It didn't define
a debug wrapper for refs_read_symbolic_ref(). Now that we do we don't
need an implementation that'll ever fall back on
refs_read_raw_ref(). It's now a stand-alone API function without a
fallback.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (5):
  refs: use designated initializers for "struct ref_storage_be"
  refs: use designated initializers for "struct ref_iterator_vtable"
  misc *.c: use designated initializers for struct assignments
  packed-backend: remove stub BUG(...) functions
  refs debug: add a wrapper for "read_symbolic_ref"
