Subject: [PATCH v5 0/4] parse-options: properly align continued usage output
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This series changes usage_with_options_internal() in parse-options.c
to properly align continued "\n" usage output.

There's only a very small typo changes in this v5 in response to
https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqq8s01geov.fsf@gitster.g/; I also
re-read the rest over & spellchecked the comments I added, for
whatever that's worth.

I didn't add a test in t/helper/ as Junio suggested, since it's the
usage message itself it doesn't slot nicely into the control flow of
t/helper/test-run-command.c, we could of course make it work, but I'd
prefer to punt on it.

I think having manually tested the output should do in this
case. I.e. I manually looked at all the "-h" emitted by t0012-help.sh
and it's all nicely formatted now (aside from some overly long lines,
addressing that is left for another day).
