Subject: [PATCH 0/6] revisions API: fix more memory leaks
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This short series fixes a couple of mistakes in 1-2/6 that snuck in in
the revisions_release() series, those compliment the already queued
jk/diff-files-cleanup-fix.

The rest of this fixes a few tricky remaining memory leaks, allowing
us to mark the tests seen in the diffstat as passing with
SANITIZE=leak.

The "git show" leak in 4/6 in particular showed up in a lot of places
in our test suite, so fixing it really helps us to accelerate towards
marking more entire tests as leak-free.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (6):
  bisect.c: add missing "goto" for release_revisions()
  test-fast-rebase helper: use release_revisions() (again)
  log: make the intent of cmd_show()'s "rev.pending" juggling clearer
  log: fix common "rev.pending" memory leak in "git show"
  bisect.c: partially fix bisect_rev_setup() memory leak
  revisions API: don't leak memory on argv elements that need free()-ing
