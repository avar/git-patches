Subject: [PATCH 0/2] diff tests: un-flaky and post-gettext-poison cleanup
MIME-Version: 1.0

In reply to [1] because they're related post-GETTEXT_POISON cleanup,
but both apply on top of master.

I had a flaky t4013 test with some local WIP code that I hadn't
investigated, as it turns out re-running the test was hiding the
failure. 2/2 fixes that, 1/2 is a minor post-GETTEXT_POISON cleanup.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (2):
  diff tests: remove redundant case statement
  diff tests: rewrite flakyness-causing test "aid"
