Subject: [PATCH v2 00/10] Makefile: make generate-cmdlist.sh much faster
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This version of this series drops the Makefile-powered version of the
cmdlist in favor of making the shellscript much faster, mostly with
suggestions from Jeff King.

I still think that splitting out the generated data into files may be
useful for unifying the Documentation/ and C code build processes,
there's another custom parser for command-list.txt in
Documentation/cmd-list.perl.

But if and when I've got something for that I can dig that out of the
v1, in the meantime the v1 of this should be mostly uncontroversial.

The last tow patches make things a bit slower for me, but since they
replace command invocations with pure-shell logic they presumably make
things a bit less painful on e.g. Windows, and the 8th patch here
already made things quite very fast already.

Jeff King (1):
  generate-cmdlist.sh: do not shell out to "sed"

Johannes Sixt (2):
  generate-cmdlist.sh: spawn fewer processes
  generate-cmdlist.sh: replace for loop by printf's auto-repeat feature

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (7):
  command-list.txt: sort with "LC_ALL=C sort"
  generate-cmdlist.sh: trivial whitespace change
  generate-cmdlist.sh: don't call get_categories() from category_list()
  generate-cmdlist.sh: run "grep | sort", not "sort | grep"
  generate-cmdlist.sh: stop sorting category lines
  generate-cmdlist.sh: replace "grep' invocation with a shell version
  generate-cmdlist.sh: replace "cut", "tr" and "grep" with pure-shell
