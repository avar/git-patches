Subject: [PATCH v2 00/11] fix "git reflog expire" race & get rid of EISDIR in refs API
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

This is a follow-up to the much smaller one-patch v1:
https://lore.kernel.org/git/patch-1.1-de0838fe99-20210714T111351Z-avarab@gmail.com/

As noted in the discussion there there's a potential loose end with
one of the 4 callers of lock_ref_oid_basic().

I'd forgotten that I fixed a bug in 2019 by removing the OID call to
that one caller[1]. It didn't get integrated for no particularly good
reason, had some "prep" series it depended on, it looked good to
reviewers, but I just forgot to pursue it after the prep patches
landed.

That patch has been running in a large production for a long time, and
as far as I know still is. The version of it we end up with here is
the same in all the important ways, I just clean up the immediate
caller as well (and there's some prep patches for that).

There's still some loose ends left in builtin/reflog.c after that, but
it's not important for correctness. I've got a 7-patch series
post-this for that, hopefully I'll remember to submit it this time.

    -    refs file backend: remove dead "errno == EISDIR" code
    +    refs/files: remove unused "errno == EISDIR" code
     
         When we lock a reference like "foo" we need to handle the case where
         "foo" exists, but is an empty directory. That's what this code added

         Since a1c1d8170d (refs_resolve_ref_unsafe: handle d/f conflicts for
    -    writes, 2017-10-06) we don't, because our our callstack will look
    -    something like:
    +    writes, 2017-10-06) we don't. E.g. in the case of
    +    files_copy_or_rename_ref() our callstack will look something like:
     
    -        files_copy_or_rename_ref() -> lock_ref_oid_basic() -> refs_resolve_ref_unsafe()
    +            [...] ->

    +            lock_ref_oid_basic() ->
    +            refs_resolve_ref_unsafe()
     
    -    And then the refs_resolve_ref_unsafe() call here will in turn (in the
    -    code added in a1c1d8170d) do the equivalent of this (via a call to
    -    refs_read_raw_ref()):
    +    At that point the first (now only) refs_resolve_ref_unsafe() call in
    +    lock_ref_oid_basic() would do the equivalent of this in the resulting
    +    call to refs_read_raw_ref() in refs_resolve_ref_unsafe():

         We then proceed with the entire ref update and don't call
         remove_empty_directories() until we call commit_ref_update(). See
         5387c0d883 (commit_ref(): if there is an empty dir in the way, delete

    +    a1c1d8170db (refs_resolve_ref_unsafe: handle d/f conflicts for writes,
    +    2017-10-06) for the commit that changed the original codepath added in
    +    bc7127ef0f to use this "EISDIR" handling.
    +
    +    Further historical commentary:
    +
    +    Before the two preceding commits the caller in files_reflog_expire()
    +    was the only one out of our 4 callers that would pass non-NULL as an
    +    oid. We would then set a (now gone) "resolve_flags" to
    +    "RESOLVE_REF_READING" and just before that "errno != EISDIR" check do:
    +
    +            if (resolve_flags & RESOLVE_REF_READING)
    +                    return NULL;
    +
    +    There may have been some case where this ended up mattering and we
    +    couldn't safely make this change before we removed the "oid"
    +    parameter, but I don't think there was, see [1] for some discussion on
    +    that.
    +
    +    In any case, now that we've removed the "oid" parameter in a preceding
    +    commit we can be sure that this code is redundant, so let's remove it.
