Subject: [PATCH v2 0/3] Makefile: misc trivial fixes
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

A base topic for some larger changes. See the v1 CL for a summary:
http://lore.kernel.org/git/cover-0.3-0000000000-20210617T095827Z-avarab@gmail.com

The only changes since v1 are to commit message issues pointed out by
Felipe and a trivial whitespace change. I also updated the commit
message of 2/3 as he suggested to point out why the change is being
made.

  Makefile: mark "check" target as .PHONY
  Makefile: stop hardcoding {command,config}-list.h

         added in 029bac01a8 (Makefile: add {program,xdiff,test,git,fuzz}-objs
         & objects targets, 2021-02-23).
     
    +    A follow-up commit (not part of this series) will add a new generated
    +    hook-list.h. By doing this refactoring we'll only need to add the new
    +    file to the GENERATED_H variable, not EXCEPT_HDRS, the vcbuild/README
    +    etc.
    +
         I have not tested the Windows-specific change in config.mak.uname
         being made here, but we use other variables from the Makefile in the
         same block, and the GENERATED_H is fully defined before we include
         config.mak.uname.
     
         Hardcoding command-list.h there seems to have been a case of
    -    copy/paste programming in dce7d29551 (msvc: support building Git using
    -    MS Visual C++, 2019-06-25). The config-list.h was added later in
    -    709df95b78 (help: move list_config_help to builtin/help, 2020-04-16).
    +    copy/paste programming in 976aaedca0 (msvc: add a Makefile target to

         The rest of it was also somewhere between inaccurate and outdated,
