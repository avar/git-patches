Subject: [PATCH 2/7] grep: skip pthreads overhead when using one thread
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Skip the administrative overhead of using pthreads when only using one
thread. Instead take the non-threaded path which would be taken under
NO_PTHREADS.

The threading support was initially added in commit
5b594f457a ("Threaded grep", 2010-01-25) with a hardcoded compile-time
number of 8 threads. Later the number of threads was made configurable
in commit 89f09dd34e ("grep: add --threads=<num> option and
grep.threads configuration", 2015-12-15).

That change did not add any special handling for --threads=1. Now we
take a slightly faster path by skipping thread handling entirely when
1 thread is requested.
