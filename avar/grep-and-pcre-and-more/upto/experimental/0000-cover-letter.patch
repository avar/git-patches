Subject: [PATCH 0/7] PCRE v2, PCRE v1 JIT, log -P & fixes
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This goes on top of the 29 patch series of "Easy to review grep &
pre-PCRE changes" (<20170511091829.5634-1-avarab@gmail.com>;
https://public-inbox.org/git/20170511091829.5634-1-avarab@gmail.com/).

This could be split into 3 unrelated things, but I have think it's
probably easier for everyone to bundle these up, since they all go on
top of the other series. Comments below:

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (7):
  grep: don't redundantly compile throwaway patterns under threading
  grep: skip pthreads overhead when using one thread

Internal changes to grep to not redundantly spawn threads. No
functional changes, just internal cleanup.

  log: add -P as a synonym for --perl-regexp

Trivial change to add -P.

  grep: add support for the PCRE v1 JIT API
  grep: un-break building with PCRE < 8.32
  grep: un-break building with PCRE < 8.20

I tested ancient versions of PCRE, which turned up build issues that
are fixed this time around.

  grep: add support for PCRE v2

The main point of this whole thing.
