Subject: [PATCH v3 03/32] cache.h: add a comment to object_type()
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Add a comment to the object_type() function to explain what it
returns, and what the "mode" is in the "else" case.

The object_type() function dates back to 4d1012c3709 (Fix rev-list
when showing objects involving submodules, 2007-11-11). It's not
immediately obvious to someone looking at its history and how it's
come to be used.

Despite what Linus noted in 4d1012c3709 (Fix rev-list when showing
objects involving submodules, 2007-11-11) about wanting to move away
from users of object_type() relying on S_ISLNK(mode) being true here
we do currently rely on that. If this is changed to a condition to
only return OBJ_BLOB on S_ISREG(mode) then t4008, t4023 and t7415 will
have failing tests.
