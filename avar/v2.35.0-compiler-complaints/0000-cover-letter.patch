Subject: [PATCH 0/3] Fix SunCC compiler complaints new in v2.35.0-rc0
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This trivial set of patches fixes compiler complaints from SunCC on
Solaris that are new in v2.35.0-rc0.

The first two are only a minor annoyance, and not the first or only
warnings of those categories that we emit, but if we can avoid adding
new ones...

The third one is a generic integer overflow bug, and will probably
result in logic errors or failures in the reftable tests on some other
platform.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (3):
  test-tool genzeros: initialize "zeros" to avoid SunCC warning
  reftable: remove unreachable "return" statements
  reftable tests: avoid "int" overflow, use "uint64_t"
