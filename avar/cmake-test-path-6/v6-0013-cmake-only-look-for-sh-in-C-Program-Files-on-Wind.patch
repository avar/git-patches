Subject: [PATCH v6 13/15] cmake: only look for "sh" in "C:/Program Files" on
 Windows
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Guard the finding of "SH_EXE" in "C:\Program Files" with a check for
whether we're on Windows.

This Windows-specific code was first added in [1], and later expanded
on [2], but since some of that was added this build recipe has been
made portable outside of Windows.

1. 72b6eeb81b1 (cmake: do find Git for Windows' shell interpreter,
   2020-09-28)
2. 476e54b1c60 (cmake: support local installations of git,
   2022-07-27).
