Subject: [PATCH 0/6] hook API: connect hooks to the TTY again, fixes a v2.36.0 regression
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This fixes the regression reported by Anthony Sottile[1] with hooks
not being connected to a TTY. See 6/6 for details.

It would also have been possible to rip the
run_processes_parallel_tr2() out of hook.c, as we currently only use
it for nproc=1. However it's the plan to have it run multiple hooks,
and as 3/6 argues it's a good idea in general for our parallel
execution API to learn a mode similar to GNU parallel's "--ungroup",
even though at the conclusion of this series the hook API is its only
user.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (6):
  run-command API: replace run_processes_parallel_tr2() with opts struct
  run-command tests: test stdout of run_command_parallel()
  run-command: add an "ungroup" option to run_process_parallel()
  hook tests: fix redirection logic error in 96e7225b310
  hook API: don't redundantly re-set "no_stdin" and "stdout_to_stderr"
  hook API: fix v2.36.0 regression: hooks should be connected to a TTY
