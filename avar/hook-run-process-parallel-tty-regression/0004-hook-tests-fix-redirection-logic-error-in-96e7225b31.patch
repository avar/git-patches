Subject: [PATCH 4/6] hook tests: fix redirection logic error in 96e7225b310
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The tests added in 96e7225b310 (hook: add 'run' subcommand,
2021-12-22) were redirecting to "actual" both in the body of the hook
itself and in the testing code below.

The net result was that the "2>>actual" redirection later in the test
wasn't doing anything. Let's have those redirection do what it looks
like they're doing.
