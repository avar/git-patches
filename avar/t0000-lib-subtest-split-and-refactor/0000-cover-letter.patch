Subject: [PATCH 0/8] test-lib tests: split off subtest code in t0000 into lib-subtest.sh
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This refactors the testing of test-lib.sh itself in t0000 into a
lib-subtest.sh, fixing duplicate setup, bugs and various shell nits
along the way.

This was waiting on my now-merged 2019256717d (Merge branch
'ab/test-lib-updates', 2021-06-14).

There's a conflict here with Felipe's proposed
http://lore.kernel.org/git/20210609170520.67014-1-felipe.contreras@gmail.com,
but it's just a matter of moving the fix around and solving a trivial
conflict. I thought it was better to submit this now anyway, while
this code is fresh in people's minds.

I'm hoping Felipe will take some variant of my
http://lore.kernel.org/git/8735tk22if.fsf@evledraar.gmail.com and
perhaps review this series & base his patch on top of these changes,
but alternatively they can go in independently with Junio solving the
conflict.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (8):
  test-lib tests: move "run_sub_test" to a new lib-subtest.sh
  test-lib tests: split up "write and run" into two functions
  test-lib tests: stop using a subshell in write_sub_test_lib_test()
  test-lib tests: don't provide a description for the sub-tests
  test-lib tests: get rid of copy/pasted mock test code
  test-lib tests: avoid subshell for "test_cmp" for readability
  test-lib tests: refactor common part of check_sub_test_lib_test*()
  test-lib tests: assert 1 exit code, not non-zero
