Subject: [PATCH v2 18/27] gitattributes doc: reword discussion of built-in
 userdiff patterns
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Reword the discussion of the built-in userdiff patterns to make it
more natural to precede it with a discussion about the semantics of
pattern matching, instead of assuming that it follows right after the
"diff.tex.xfuncname" example which now immediately precedes it. This
will make a follow-up commit smaller.
