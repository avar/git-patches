Subject: [PATCH v2 16/27] userdiff tests: do not do compile tests on "custom"
 pattern
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Since f1b75fbaf1 (t4018: convert custom pattern test to the new
infrastructure, 2014-03-21) we have been doing the basic sanity check
of whether patterns in userdiff.c compile on the "custom" patterns.

That we were doing this was an emergent effect of that change and an
earlier refactoring in bfa7d01413 (t4018: an infrastructure to test
hunk headers, 2014-03-21).

This was never intended by the test added in
e3bf5e43fd (t4018-diff-funcname: test syntax of builtin xfuncname
patterns, 2008-09-22), nor is there any point in doing this. We'll
error out in the custom.sh test itself if those patterns don't
compile.
