Subject: [PATCH v2 2/5] Revert and amend "test-lib-functions: assert correct
 parameter count"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This reverts and amends my my own e7884b353b7 (test-lib-functions:
assert correct parameter count, 2021-02-12) in order to improve the -x
output.

The goal here is to get rid of the verbosity of having e.g. a "test 2
-ne 2" line for every "test_cmp". We use "$@" as an argument to "test"
to intentionally feed the "test" operator too many arguments if the
functions are called with too many arguments, thus piggy-backing on it
to check the number of arguments we get.

Before this for each test_cmp invocation we'd emit:

    + test_cmp expect actual
    + test 2 -ne 2
    + eval diff -u "$@"
    + diff -u expect actual

That "test 2 -ne 2" line is new in my e7884b353b7. As noted in
45a2686441b (test-lib-functions: remove bug-inducing "diagnostics"
helper param, 2021-02-12) we had buggy invocations of some of these
functions with too many parameters.

Now we'll get just:

    + test_cmp expect actual
    + eval diff -u "$@"
    + diff -u expect actual

This does not to the "right" thing in cases like:

    test_path_is_file x -a y

Which will now turn into:

    test -f x -a y

I consider that to be OK given the trade-off that any extra checking
would produce more verbose trace output. As shown in 45a2686441b we
had issues with these functions being invoked with multiple
parameters (e.g. a glob) by accident, we don't need to be paranoid in
guarding against hostile misuse from our own test suite.

While I'm at it change a few functions that relied on a "false" being
the last statement in the function to use an explicit "return 1" like
the other functions in this file.
