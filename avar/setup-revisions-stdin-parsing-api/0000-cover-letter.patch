Subject: [PATCH 0/4] pack-objects: use revision.c's --stdin parsing
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The revision.c handles the --stdin flag given to "git rev-list", and
various other commands use it to take rev-list-like arguments.

The pack-objects.c builtin made use of the revevisio.c API, and did
mostly the same handling of stdin, with a couple of minor differences.

This series extends the revision.c API to be flexible enough to handle
the pack-objects.c case, and moves pack-objects.c over to that new
API. The missing piece was to allow the definition of a
"handle_stdin_line" callback. This new callback allows for either
partially or entirely consuming the stdin before handing it off (or
not) to the revision.c logic.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (4):
  upload-pack: run is_repository_shallow() before setup_revisions()
  revision.h: unify "disable_stdin" and "read_from_stdin"
  pack-objects.c: do stdin parsing via revision.c's API
  pack-objects.c: make use of REV_INFO_STDIN_LINE_PROCESS
