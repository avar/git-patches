Subject: [PATCH 00/10] t5510: fix the quoting mess
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Since the upthread quoting discussion pointed at a commit of mine I
felt obligated to look at this in a deeper way.

When I added those tests I carried forward some technical debt where
we were passing arguments to a function as a string, instead of as
multiple arguments which we could get with "$@", in hindsight that was
a big mistake.

As far as I can tell the proposed
https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqqy1xpg3th.fsf@gitster.g/ fixes the
issue at hand, but this is the deeper and I think better direction to
go in (but I could rebase in top of that fix if needed, although the
conflict is trivial, keep this side).

Now we don't use "perl", or "sed", or whatever to re-quote arguments
in t/t5510-fetch.sh.

There's still some weirdness in that test, e.g. the whole behavior of
set_config_tristate(), but I had to stop somewhere.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (10):
  fetch tests: remove redundant test_unconfig()
  fetch tests: use named, not positional parameters
  fetch tests: use "local", &&-chaining, style etc.
  fetch tests: add a helper to avoid boilerplate
  fetch tests: pass "mode" parameter first, pave way for "$@"
  fetch tests: pass a list, not a string of arguments
  fetch tests: remove lazy variable setup
  fetch tests: remove shelling out for previously "lazy" variables
  fetch tests: stop implicitly adding refspecs
  fetch tests: fix needless and buggy re-quoting
