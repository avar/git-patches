Subject: [PATCH v8 0/3] bundle doc: generalize & elaborate
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

As mentioned in v7 I got rid of the comparisons of the bundle header
to the format of show-ref:
https://lore.kernel.org/git/cover-0.3-0000000000-20210727T002001Z-avarab@gmail.com

Except I managed to miss that it was in two places in the series,
sorry. Here's an update with what I meant to send in v7.

Junio also mentioned it being confusing that we mix "basis" and
"object prerequisites", I agree, but wanted to keep these changes
minimal, so I wasn't rewording the existing occurances of "basis".

This now has a minimal patch-on-top which follows up and rewords those
existing and moved-around occurrences of "basis" to "[commit|object]
prerequisite(s)".
