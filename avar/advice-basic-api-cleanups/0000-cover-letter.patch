Subject: [PATCH 0/5] advice API: simplification, small fixes, readability
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

A follow-up to recent advice.[ch] improvements in fd0d7036e0d (Merge
branch 'ab/retire-advice-config', 2021-09-10). There are no in-flight
additions of new advice variables, and this doesn't conflict with
"seen". So now seems like a good time to submit this.

The API carried some complexity due to needing to alias one of the
variables, which goes away in 3/5, 4/5 then further reduces the
boilerplate/verbosity of it.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (5):
  advice.h: don't indent top-level enum
  advice output: emit empty lines as "hint:", not "hint: "
  advice.[ch]: remove advice.pushNonFastForward alias
  advice API: revamp the API, again
  advice.[ch]: sort enum fields in alphabetical order
