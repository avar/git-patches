Subject: [PATCH v2 00/11] tests: add a bash "set -o pipefail" test mode
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

An unstated aim of v1 of this series was to fix up the tests on
vanilla bash's "set -o pipefail" enough that the test suite would have
some failures, but wouldn't look like a complete dumpster fire.

But this was confusing and relied on a side-quest to change the
test_{must,might}_fail helpers. See
https://lore.kernel.org/git/YAFntgQE3NZ3yQx5@coredump.intra.peff.net/

I've now ejected all of that, in favor of just fixing some of the
tests instead as Jeff suggested. Jeff, I added your Signed-off-by to
06/11 which you're mostly the author of. Please Ack that you're OK
with that (the original diff-for-discussin didn't have a SOB).

Jeff King (1):
  git-svn tests: rewrite brittle tests to use "--[no-]merges".

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (10):
  cache-tree tests: remove unused $2 parameter
  cache-tree tests: use a sub-shell with less indirection
  cache-tree tests: refactor overly complex function
  git svn mergeinfo tests: modernize redirection & quoting style
  git svn mergeinfo tests: refactor "test -z" to use test_must_be_empty
  rm tests: actually test for SIGPIPE in SIGPIPE test
  upload-pack tests: avoid a non-zero "grep" exit status
  archive tests: use a cheaper "zipinfo -h" invocation to get header
  tests: split up bash detection library
  tests: add a "set -o pipefail" for a patched bash

         This series relies on a patch of mine to bash, which I'm submitting
    -    upstream. Vanilla bash ignores SIGPIPE under "set -e" since version
    -    3.1. It's only under "set -o pipefail" (added in 3.2) that it doesn't
    -    take account of SIGPIPE, in a seeming omission nobody bothered to fix
    -    yet.

    +    breakages if they turn it on explicitly with "GIT_TEST_PIPEFAIL=true".
