Subject: [PATCH 0/2] string_list API users: use alloc + init, not calloc + strdup_strings
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

As a small follow-up to Junio's
https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqq7d471dns.fsf@gitster.g/; This is a
small set of fixes to use the string_list functions rather than
peeking into its guts during initalization.

I've been running my local git version with these changes for almost a
year, but for submision I wrote a coccinelle rule to cover most of it
in 1/2, along with a tests using the new recently landed coccicheck
test support.

The 2/2 is then things I had to manually change still, which weren't
covered by the conservative rule.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (2):
  string_list API users + cocci: use string_list_init_dup()
  string-list API users: manually use string_list_init_*()
