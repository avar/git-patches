Subject: [PATCH v3 5/9] Makefile: rephrase the discussion of *_SHA1 knobs
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

In the preceding commit the discussion of the *_SHA1 knobs was left
as-is to benefit from a smaller diff, but since we're changing these
let's use the same phrasing we use for most other knobs. E.g. "define
X", not "define X environment variable", and get rid of the "when
running make to link with" entirely.

Furthermore the discussion of DC_SHA1* options is now under a "Options
for the sha1collisiondetection implementation" heading, so we don't
need to clarify that these options go along with DC_SHA1=Y, so let's
rephrase them accordingly.
