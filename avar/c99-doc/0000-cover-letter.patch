Subject: [PATCH 0/5] CodingGuidelines: various C99 updates
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This series:

 * Rephrases CodingGuidelines so that we note we're on C99, and then
   lists exceptions and features we use. The previous prose assumed
   C89 by default.

   We still explicitly avoid opening the "feel free to use an C99
   feature" floodgates.

 * Mentions that you can use dynamic C99 initializer elements. See the
   recent discussion at
   https://lore.kernel.org/git/221006.86a668r5mf.gmgdl@evledraar.gmail.com/

 * Allows us to use "for (int i". I didn't set out to (slightly) jump
   the gun on this, but just pulling the trigger around ~20 days early
   makes it easier to ...

 * ...add the natural follow-up section of C99 features you explicitly
   shouldn't be using yet, to which I added the two cases I could
   remember (in 4-5/5).

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (5):
  CodingGuidelines: update for C99
  CodingGuidelines: mention dynamic C99 initializer elements
  CodingGuidelines: allow declaring variables in for loops
  CodingGuidelines: mention C99 features we can't use
  CodingGuidelines: recommend against unportable C99 struct syntax
