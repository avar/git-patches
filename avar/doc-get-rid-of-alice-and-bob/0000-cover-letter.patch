Subject: [PATCH 0/6] doc: replace "alice" and "bob" examples
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

I suggested in [1] that the "alice" and "bob" examples in our
documentation would be better written without a reference to such
fictional characters, for reasons that have nothing to do with trying
to bend over backwards to avoid any reference to people's gender. It
just makes for better documentation.

Since it's clear that Derrick's not interested in picking up that task
in his parallel series[2] here a brief series to implement that. This
leaves the only occurances of "alice" and "bob" (and "david" and
"cindy") at the bottom of giteveryday(7). Those could also be changed,
but I didn't think doing so provided a clear benefit, unlike the
changes being made here.
