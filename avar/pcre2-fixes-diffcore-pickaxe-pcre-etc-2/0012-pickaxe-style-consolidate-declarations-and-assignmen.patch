Subject: [PATCH v2 12/22] pickaxe/style: consolidate declarations and
 assignments
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Refactor contains() to do its assignments at the same time that it
does its declarations.

This code could have been refactored in ef90ab66e8e (pickaxe: use
textconv for -S counting, 2012-10-28) when a function call between the
declarations and assignments was removed.
