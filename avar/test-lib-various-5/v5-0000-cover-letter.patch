    @@ Commit message
             from "mkdir .git/hooks" changes various tests needed to re-setup
             that directory. Now they no longer do.
     
    -     5. Since we don't need to move the .git/hooks directory we don't need
    -        the subshell here either.
    -
    -        See 0d314ce834 for when the subshell use got introduced for the
    -        convenience of not having to "cd" back and forth while setting up
    -        the hooks.
    +        This makes us implicitly depend on the default hooks being
    +        disabled, which is a good thing. If and when we'd have any
    +        on-by-default hooks (I see no reason we ever would) we'd want to
    +        see the subtle and not so subtle ways that would break the test
    +        suite.
    +
    +     5. We don't need to "cd" to the "$repo" directory at all anymore.
    +
    +        In the code being removed here we both "cd"'d to the repository
    +        before calling "init", and did so in a subshell.
    +
    +        It's not important to do either, so both of those can be
    +        removed. We cd'd because this code grew from test-lib.sh code
    +        where we'd have done so already, see eedf8f97e58 (Abstract
    +        test_create_repo out for use in tests., 2006-02-17), and later
    +        "cd"'d inside a subshell since 0d314ce834d to avoid having to keep
    +        track of an "old pwd" variable to cd back after the setup.
    +
    +        Being in the repository directory made moving the hooks around
    +        easier (we wouldn't have to fully qualify the path). Since we're
    +        not moving the hooks per #4 above we don't need to "cd" for that
    +        reason either.
     
          6. We can drop the --template argument and instead rely on the
             GIT_TEMPLATE_DIR set to the same path earlier in test-lib.sh. See
