         I'm fixing now in "git branch --set-upstream-to", see
         6183d826ba6 (branch: introduce --set-upstream-to, 2012-08-20).
     
    -    The error message I'm adding here is an amalgamation of the error
    +    The warning message I'm adding here is an amalgamation of the error
         added for "git branch" in 8efb8899cfe, and the error output
         install_branch_config() itself emits, i.e. it trims "refs/heads/" from
         the name and says "branch X on remote", not "branch refs/heads/X on
         remote".
     
    +    I think it would make more sense to simply die() here, but in the
    +    other checks for --set-upstream added in 24bc1a12926 we issue a
    +    warning() instead. Let's do the same here for consistency for now.
    +
    +    There was an earlier submitted alternate way of fixing this in [1],
    +    due to that patch breaking threading with the original report at [2] I
    +    didn't notice it before authoring this version. I think the more
    +    detailed warning message here is better, and we should also have tests
    +    for this behavior.
