Subject: [PATCH v3 0/1] Makefiles: GNU make 4.4 fixes
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

A now much-smaller re-roll of a potential for-v2.39.0 fix for GNU make
4.4 compatibility.

Junio: Sorry about the overlapping submission, at the time I didn't
see Paul's in the "What's Cooking", and thought it hadn't been picked
up at all (maybe I just forgot to look at the actual branches).

This v3 is just the "MAKEFLAGS" patch. I agree with your [2] that we
might want to leave this post-release, i.e. it'll just be (a lot) more
verbose, but does it break anything? Probably not.

On the other hand the fix here is trivial, and literally just the
exact solution to this compatibility problem suggested by GNU make's
"NEWS" file, and nothing else. So merging this before the release
should be low-risk...
