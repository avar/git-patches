Subject: [PATCH v3 0/2] SubmittingPatches: talk about GitHub CI, not Travis + move-only
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This is a late-re-roll of this v2:
https://lore.kernel.org/git/cover-0.3-0000000000-20210607T110044Z-avarab@gmail.com/

I fixed the problems Đoàn Trần Công Danh and SZEDER Gábor pointed out
in v2.

I ejected the removal of the inline patch for Pine from this
verison. Johannes suggest another approach in
https://lore.kernel.org/git/nycvar.QRO.7.76.6.2106072346560.55@tvgsbejvaqbjf.bet/

I think we're spending way too much reader time on [Al]pine still, but
I don't want to write something that's accurate advice for an E-Mail
client I've never used, so I'm dropping it. Perhaps someone else will
pick that cleanup up...

  SubmittingPatches: move discussion of Signed-off-by above "send"
