Subject: [PATCH 0/6] help: fix usage nits & bugs, completion shellscript->C
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This series fixes various bugs & edge cases in the "git help" command,
and improves and splits the internal-only "--completion-for-config"
option into two, and as a result can get rid of an awk/sort -u
pipeline in the bash completion.

This is all rather straightforward and boring, the first patch
mentions an interaction with my not-picked-up-by-Junio-yet series to
fix parse_options usage alignment at [1], but while the two strictly
speaking "semantically conflict" (in combination they'll produce
different results), the exact whitespace padding of "git help -h" is a
trivial enough issue that they can and should be considered
indepedently.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (6):
  help: correct the usage string in -h and documentation
  help: correct usage string for "git help --guides"
  help tests: add test for --config output
  help: refactor "for_human" control flow in cmd_help()
  help: correct logic error in combining --all and --config
  help / completion: make "git help" do the hard work
