Subject: [PATCH v3 00/16] Various changes to the "tag" command & related
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Hopefully the last version of this. Changes since v2 in
<20170321125901.10652-1-avarab@gmail.com>:

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (16):
  tag doc: move the description of --[no-]merged earlier
  tag doc: split up the --[no-]merged documentation
  tag doc: reword --[no-]merged to talk about commits, not tips
  ref-filter: make combining --merged & --no-merged an error

No changes.

  ref-filter: add test for --contains on a non-commit

Minor grammar fixes in the commit message, as pointed out on-list.

  tag: remove a TODO item from the test suite
  tag tests: fix a typo in a test description
  for-each-ref: partly change <object> to <commit> in help

No changes.

  tag: add more incompatibles mode tests

Reworded the commit message to be less confusing, as pointed out
on-list & added a few more tests for incompatible model, e.g. modes,
e.g. "-l -v -d".

  parse-options: add OPT_NONEG to the "contains" option

NEW: Junio pointed out that my new --without should have a OPT_NONEG,
which made me notice that --with and --contains have also had the same
bug for ages without anyone noticing, add OPT_NONEG to them all.

  tag: change misleading --list <pattern> documentation

Hopefully solves the sticking point with the "-l <pat> -l <pat>" test
I'm adding, there's now a big fat comment saying this was never
intended behavior but we want to test it blah blah.

Also change `git tag <pattern>` -> `git tag <tagname>`. See also my
just-sent "[PATCH] branch doc: Change `git branch <pattern>` to use
`<branchname>`".

  tag: implicitly supply --list given another list-like option

Minor typo fix in commit message, as pointed out on-list.

Squashed the "tag: implicitly supply --list given the -n option" patch
into this, as discussed on-list.

  tag: change --point-at to default to HEAD
  ref-filter: add --no-contains option to tag/branch/for-each-ref

The new --no-contains & --without options also have OPT_NONEG now.

  ref-filter: reflow recently changed branch/tag/for-each-ref docs

Add missing Signed-off-by.

  tag: add tests for --with and --without

Add a couple of extra tests asserting that --no-with and --no-without
error out.
