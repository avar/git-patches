Subject: [PATCH 0/3] commit-graph: make "verify" work with replace refs
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This changes "commit-graph verify" to ignore replace refs, as
"commit-graph write" already does.

The 3/3 is a rather simple fix, and unblocks another series that wants
to fix the GIT_TEST_COMMIT_GRAPH mode.

1-2/3 are fixes to existing commit-graph tests. I just wanted to use
the "graph_git_two_modes" helper, but it was broken, including in a
way that hid an existing failure in a years-old test..

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (3):
  commit-graph tests: fix error-hiding graph_git_two_modes() helper
  commit-graph tests: fix another graph_git_two_modes() helper
  commit-graph: don't consider "replace" objects with "verify"
