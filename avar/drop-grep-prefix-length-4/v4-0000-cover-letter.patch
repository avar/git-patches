Subject: [PATCH v4 0/7] grep: simplify & delete "init" & "config" code
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

A simplification and code deletion of the overly complex setup for the
grep API, no behavior changes. For v3 see:
https://lore.kernel.org/git/cover-v3-0.7-00000000000-20211129T143956Z-avarab@gmail.com/

As Junio notes in
https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqqbl22634q.fsf@gitster.g/ my previous
3/7 had entirely the wrong commit message for the change it was
making, i.e. the code itself was correct, but I somehow got things
reversed in my head when writing the explanation.

That's fixed here, and for good measure I added another related test
to the same commit for the same existing behavior.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (7):
  grep.h: remove unused "regex_t regexp" from grep_opt
  log tests: check if grep_config() is called by "log"-like cmds
  grep tests: add missing "grep.patternType" config test
  built-ins: trust the "prefix" from run_builtin()
  grep.c: don't pass along NULL callback value
  grep API: call grep_config() after grep_init()
  grep: simplify config parsing and option parsing
