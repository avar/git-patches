Subject: [PATCH 0/9] test-tool: fix memory leaks
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This is a series of trivial leak-fixes which allows us to mark various
tests as entirely passing under SANITIZE=leak, the reasn they weren't
passing before was because we'd spot memory leaks in test-tool, rather
than git itself.

This is a sibling series to my just-submitted series for fixing memory
leaks in built-ins[1], but the the two do not textually or
semantically conflict.

There are still a few other test-tool memory leaks, but these are the
ones I had patches ready for, having focused on trying to get t00*.sh
passing first, and then picking some low-hanging fruit after that.

Passing CI for this series can be found at [2].
