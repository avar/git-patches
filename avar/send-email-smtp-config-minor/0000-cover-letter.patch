Subject: [PATCH 0/2] send-email: simplify smtp.{smtpssl,smtpencryption} parsing
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

As noted in 1/2 I unintentionally broke the deprecated
sendemail.smtpssl configuration parsing a while ago. Since nothing
actually uses it let's remove it.

This doesn't conflict with Drew's
http://lore.kernel.org/git/20210411125431.28971-1-sir@cmpwn.com
series, but as I'll reply to there knowing that we can do this might
simplify some things for it, if it were to be based on top of this.0

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (2):
  send-email: remove non-working support for "sendemail.smtpssl"
  send-email: refactor sendemail.smtpencryption config parsing
