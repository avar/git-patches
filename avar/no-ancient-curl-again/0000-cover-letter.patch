Subject: [PATCH 0/5] post-v2.33 "drop support for ancient curl" follow-up
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This is a follow-up to the already-integrated topic for dropping
support for older curl versions submitted before the v2.33 release[1].

No verions become unsupported in this topic, this is a mere clean-up.

There were a couple of cases where we either already dropped support
for something, but got the curl version wrong in a macro comparison,
or just got the version wrong. That's now corrected.

But more importantly this introduces a git-curl-compat.h header which
centarlizes all our curl version dependencies, and any compatability
shims we've got to deal with those versions. This makes the code much
easier to read and maintain than inline LIBCURL_VERSION_NUM version
comparisons, and will make any future dropping of supported curl
versions in the future easier to perform & review.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (5):
  http: drop support for curl < 7.18.0 (again)
  http: correct curl version check for CURLOPT_PINNEDPUBLICKEY
  http: correct version check for CURL_HTTP_VERSION_2_0
  http: centralize the accounting of libcurl dependencies
  http: don't hardcode the value of CURL_SOCKOPT_OK
