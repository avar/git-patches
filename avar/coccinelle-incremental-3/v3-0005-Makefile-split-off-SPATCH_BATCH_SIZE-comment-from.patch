Subject: [PATCH v3 05/11] Makefile: split off SPATCH_BATCH_SIZE comment from
 "cocci" heading
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Split off the "; setting[...]" part of the comment added in In
960154b9c17 (coccicheck: optionally batch spatch invocations,
2019-05-06), and restore what we had before that, which was a comment
indicating that variables for the "coccicheck" target were being set
here.

When 960154b9c17 amended the heading to discuss SPATCH_BATCH_SIZE it
left no natural place to add a new comment about other flags that
preceded it. As subsequent commits will add such comments we need to
split the existing comment up.
