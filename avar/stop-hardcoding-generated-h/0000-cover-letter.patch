Subject: [PATCH 0/3] Makefile: misc trivial fixes
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

I'm re-rolling ab/config-based-hooks-base to deal with (among other
things) a vcbuild failure. This doesn't fix that, but allows me to fix
that in one place, instead copy/pasting things all over the place.

The reason I'd need to do that is because we define GENERATED_H, but
then proceed not to use it when we should. This small series fixes
that in 2/3, and fixes a couple of adjacent trivial issues in 1/3 and
3/3.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (3):
  Makefile: mark "check" target as .PHONY
  Makefile: stop hardcoding {command,config}-list.h
  Makefile: remove an out-of-date comment
