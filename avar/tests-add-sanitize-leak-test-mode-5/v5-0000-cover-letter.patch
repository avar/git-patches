Subject: [PATCH v5 0/3] add a test mode for SANITIZE=leak, run it in CI
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

We can compile git with SANITIZE=leak, and have had various efforts in
the past such as 31f9acf9ce2 (Merge branch 'ah/plugleaks', 2021-08-04)
to plug memory leaks, but have had no CI testing of it to ensure that
we don't get regressions. This series adds a GIT_TEST_* mode for
checking those regressions, and runs it in CI.

Since I submitted v2 the delta between origin/master..origin/seen
broke even t0001-init.sh when run under SANITIZE=leak, so this series
will cause test smoke on "seen".

That failure is due to a bug in es/config-based-hooks [1] and the
hn/reftable topic, i.e. these patches are legitimately catching
regressions in "seen" from day 1.

Changes since v4 (see
https://lore.kernel.org/git/cover-v4-0.3-00000000000-20210907T151855Z-avarab@gmail.com/):

 * Renamed the jobs to linux-leaks and osx-leaks, per Jeff King's
   suggestion.

 * Took all the suggestions from Jeff King for commit message
   improvements, and tried to make some of my own fixing overly
   verbose wording/grammar errors etc.

 * Ditto the small typo fix Eric Sunshine pointed out. Thanks both!

See https://github.com/avar/git/runs/3538356269 for the CI run for
this version.
