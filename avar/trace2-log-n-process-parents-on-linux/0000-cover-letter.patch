Subject: [PATCH 0/6] tr2: plug memory leaks + logic errors + Win32 & Linux feature parity
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The just-landed 6f64eeab605 (Merge branch
'es/trace2-log-parent-process-name', 2021-08-24) added parent process
name logging, but under Linux we'd only log the immediate parent, and
the full process chain on Windows.

This brings the Linux implementation in parity with the Windows
implementation. As it turns out /proc/<PID>/stat is a bit of a pain to
parse.

This is preceded by some minor memory leak fixes to
es/trace2-log-parent-process-name, and the fixing of a bug where we'd
log the empty string as a parent if we didn't have procfs.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (6):
  tr2: remove NEEDSWORK comment for "non-procfs" implementations
  tr2: clarify TRACE2_PROCESS_INFO_EXIT comment under Linux
  tr2: stop leaking "thread_name" memory
  tr2: fix memory leak & logic error in 2f732bf15e6
  tr2: do compiler enum check in trace2_collect_process_info()
  tr2: log N parent process names on Linux
