Subject: [PATCH 00/34] doc/UX: make txt & -h output more consistent
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

We are currently wildly inconsistent in whether the SYNOPSIS in the
manual page matches the first line of the -h output, and as we add new
options we routinely forget to add them to one or the other (or both).

Without a more complex approach it's hard to do something about the
"or both" case. But we can rather easily test whether the -h output
matches the *.txt version, and report differences.

As this series shows that allows us to fix a lot of issues we've
effectively already "fixed", we just fixed them in one version, but
not the other.

We now have a test that checks that these are the same for all
built-ins. Out of 141 built-in commands we still have 58 cases that
differ at the end of this series, but that's a lot better than before.

This series is 34 patches, but it's been structured in a way that
reviewers should be able to mostly trust the "doc txt & -h
consistency" commits already. In all of those cases we already have
the post-image in-tree, it's just in either the *.txt or -h version,
not both. All of the "doc txt & -h consistency" commits merely make
those consistent together.

All of the commands and documentation altered by the "doc txt & -h
consistency" commits are then tested in 34/34, i.e. there are no
"loose ends" where we partially "fix" something, but fail to fully
test it at the end (unless I missed something).

Junio: This series merges cleanly with "seen", and I've intentionally
left out any changes that might conflict. If we get newlry queued
patches that make things inconsistent the new test will fail. Perhaps
we should make them all "TODO" and flip the switch later, but we are
going to have to test this for real at some point if we're going to
stem the tide of these routinely drifting apart.
