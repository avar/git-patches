I already found a few grammar / phrasing issues with the commit
messages, so I'll just change this on my side for a resend.

But I noticed that this casing rule wasn't documented in
SubmittingPatches, so here's a patch for that, and while I'm at it
another small improvement that I've been meaning to make to it based
on a local alias I have.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (2):
  doc/SubmittingPatches: clarify the casing convention for "area:
    change..."
  doc/SubmittingPatches: show how to get a CLI commit summary
