Subject: [PATCH 0/8] Various changes to the "tag" command
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This series incorporates and replaces all the "tag" patches I have
floating around the list, and adds a lot in the mix which discovered
while working on the initial two patches, but which made sense as
separate patches.

It's based no top of Jeff's gitster/jk/ref-filter-flags-cleanup.

I'm bundling this all together because a lot of these patches touch
the exact same code, and in other cases subsequent patches make use of
test suite improvements I made earlier in the series. So although some
could be split out entirely (e.g. the --point-at patch), I'd like to
just present them all for review together & split out any if there's
strong objections to basing them on top of each other.

I think this series changes addresses all the points brought up by
Junio/Jeff about my previous patches, except there's no extensive
discussion of how the filtering mechanism works in general as pointed
out by Junio in <xmqqwpbvumrk.fsf@gitster.mtv.corp.google.com>.

I think it makes sense to have that, but in the interest of getting
something out the door I'm not working on that for now.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (8):
  tag: Remove a TODO item from the test suite
  tag: Refactor the options handling code to be less bizarro
  tag: Change  misleading --list <pattern> documentation
  tag: Implicitly supply --list given another list-like option
  tag: Implicitly supply --list given the -n option
  ref-filter: Add --no-contains option to tag/branch/for-each-ref
  tag: Add tests for --with and --without
  tag: Change --point-at to default to HEAD
