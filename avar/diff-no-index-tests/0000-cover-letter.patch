Subject: [PATCH 0/2] diff --no-index: fix test blind spots
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

A trivial series to add tests for "git diff --no-index"'s mode
handling, and a missing test for how --exit-code behaves in
combination with --no-index while I was at it.

This would have caught the regression I inadvertently introduced
in[1]. It's related to my much larger tree-walk.h series[2], but
applies independently of that. I wanted to split it off as there were
no conflicts or behavior changes related to canon_mode() in that
series anymore.
