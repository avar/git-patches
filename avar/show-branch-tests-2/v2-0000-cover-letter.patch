Subject: [PATCH v2 0/4] show-branch: add missing tests, trivial color output change
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This v2 doesn't change any of the code (see range-diff), but better
explains the change per Michael J Gruber's feedback in
https://lore.kernel.org/git/162374905722.40525.516266574605586007.git@grubix.eu/

There's also a trivial grammar fix, s/add/odd/g.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (4):
  show-branch tests: rename the one "show-branch" test file
  show-branch tests: modernize test code
  show-branch: don't <COLOR></RESET> for space characters
  show-branch tests: add missing tests

    -    show-branch: fix and test --color output
    +    show-branch: don't <COLOR></RESET> for space characters
     
    -    Fix the "show-branch --color" output so it doesn't needlessly color
    -    and reset each time it emits a space character.
    +    Change the colored output introduced in ab07ba2a24 (show-branch: color
    +    the commit status signs, 2009-04-22) to not color and reset each
    +    individual space character we use for padding. The intent is to color
    +    just the "!", "+" etc. characters.
    +
    +    This makes the output easier to test, so let's do that now. The test
    +    would be much more verbose without a color/reset for each space
    +    character. Since the coloring cycles through colors we previously had
    +    a "rainbow of space characters".
    +
    +    In theory this breaks things for anyone who's relying on the exact
    +    colored output of show-branch, in practice I'd think anyone parsing it
    +    isn't actively turning on the colored output.
