Subject: [PATCH 0/6] mktag tests: test more exhaustively
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

In [1] I suggested that we could catch the segfault fixed in
c6854508808 (ref-filter: fix NULL check for parse object failure,
2021-04-01) (and possibly other future bugs) my extending the mktag
tests.

Junio wanted the more isolated bug fix first[2], which is fair
enough. But now that the dust has settled I figured I'd submit this
test-only series which stresses mktag, fsck and various commands that
might deal with the broken objects the mktag tests creates.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (6):
  mktag tests: parse out options in helper
  mktag tests: invert --no-strict test
  mktag tests: test hash-object --literally and unreachable fsck
  mktag tests: test update-ref and reachable fsck
  mktag tests: test for-each-ref
  mktag tests: test fast-export
