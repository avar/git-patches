Subject: [PATCH 2/2] test-lib.sh: use "Bail out!" syntax on bad SANITIZE=leak
 use
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Improve the "GIT_TEST_PASSING_SANITIZE_LEAK=true" test mode added in
956d2e4639b (tests: add a test mode for SANITIZE=leak, run it in CI,
2021-09-23) to use a TAP "Bail out!" message when exiting.

See 614fe015212 (test-lib: bail out when "-v" used under "prove",
2016-10-22) for the initial introduction of "Bail out!" to the
--verbose being amended here.

Before this compiling with "SANITIZE=" and running the tests with
"prove" would cause all the tests to be run to the end (output trimmed
for fewer columns):

    $ GIT_TEST_PASSING_SANITIZE_LEAK=true make
    rm -f -r 'test-results'
    *** prove ***
    t0000-basic.sh ......... Dubious, test returned 1 (wstat 256, 0x100)
    No subtests run
    t0001-init.sh .......... Dubious, test returned 1 (wstat 256, 0x100)
    No subtests run
    [...output where we list every single t[0-9]*.sh file as failing snipped]

Whereas now we'll fail early, like this ("->" line wrapping added):

    $ GIT_TEST_PASSING_SANITIZE_LEAK=true make
    [...]

    t0000-basic.sh ..................................... Bailout called.  Further testing stopped:
    -> GIT_TEST_PASSING_SANITIZE_LEAK=true has no effect except when compiled with SANITIZE=leak
    FAILED--Further testing stopped: GIT_TEST_PASSING_SANITIZE_LEAK=true has no effect except
    -> when compiled with SANITIZE=leak
    make: *** [Makefile:53: prove] Error 1

This change also adds a red color to the "Bailout called" line, as
we're now using "say_color error". That improves existing output in
the case of e.g.:

    $ prove -j8 t[0-9]*.sh :: -v
    Bailout called.  Further testing stopped:  verbose mode forbidden under TAP harness; try --verbose-log
    FAILED--Further testing stopped: verbose mode forbidden under TAP harness; try --verbose-log

I experimented with making BUG() and error() always be a "BAIL_OUT". I
think that's worth pursuing, but e.g. for the error about missing
"&&-chains" we'd need to support emitting multi-line messages.

TAP consumers only understand what follows the "Bail out!" message up
to the first "\n", so we can't quote the entire "test_expect_success",
as the "&&-chain" error does. I think emitting them with "say_error()"
beforehand (piped with ">&7" in the case of "BUG()") should work, but
let's leave those #leftoverbits for later.
