Subject: [PATCH 0/2] send-email: pre-release fixes for v2.32.0
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The 1/2 here fixes a bug I introduced with an error message going
missing.

The 2/2 hopefully replaces
<bb30fe2b-cd75-4782-24a6-08bb002a0367@kdbg.org>[1], but I have not
tested it on Windows. I think improving the error message is better
strategy here than working around the current Git.pm abs_path()
behavior.

This has a trivial conflict with my outstanding [2] series which is
easily solved, we just need to take the side introduced in this topic
(i.e. abs_path isn't needed anymore).

Also, I said I'd CC Robert Foss in [3] but didn't, finally doing that
here.
