         by setting "no_free" in "diff_options".
     
         This is required because when e.g. "git diff" is run we'll allocate
    -    things in that struct, use the diff machinery once, and then exit, but
    -    if we run e.g. "git log -p" we're going to re-use what we allocated
    -    across multiple diff_flush() calls, and only want to free things at
    -    the end.
    +    things in that struct, use the diff machinery once, and then exit.
    +
    +    But if we run e.g. "git log -p" we're going to re-use what we
    +    allocated across multiple diff_flush() calls, and only want to free
    +    things at the end.
     
         We've thus ended up with features like the recently added "diff -I"[1]
         where we'll leak memory. As it turns out it could have simply used the
    @@ Commit message
         the diffopt.close_file attribute, 2016-06-22).
     
         Manually adding more such flags to things log_tree_commit() every time
    -    we need to allocate something would be tedious.
    -
    -    Let's instead move that fclose() code it to a new diff_free(), in
    -    anticipation of freeing more things in that function in follow-up
    -    commits. I'm renaming the "close_file" struct member to "fclose_file"
    -    for the ease of validating this, we can be certain that these are all
    -    the relevant callsites.
    +    we need to allocate something would be tedious. Let's instead move
    +    that fclose() code it to a new diff_free(), in anticipation of freeing
    +    more things in that function in follow-up commits.
     
         Some functions such as log_tree_commit() need an idiom of optionally
         retaining a previous "no_free", as they may either free the memory
         themselves, or their caller may do so. I'm keeping that idiom in
    -    log_show_early() even though I don't think it's currently called in
    -    this manner, since it also gets passed an existing "struct rev_info"..
    +    log_show_early() for good measure, even though I don't think it's
    +    currently called in this manner. It also gets passed an existing
    +    "struct rev_info", so future callers may want to set the "no_free"
    +    flag.
    +
    +    This change is a bit hard to read because while the freeing pattern
    +    we're introducing isn't unusual, the "file" member is a special
    +    snowflake. We usually don't want to fclose() it. This is because
    +    "file" is usually stdout, in which case we don't want to fclose()
    +    it. We only want to opt-in to closing it when we e.g. open a file on
    +    the filesystem. Thus the opt-in "close_file" flag.
    +
    +    So the API in general just needs a "no_free" flag to defer freeing,
    +    but the "file" member still needs its "close_file" flag. This is made
    +    more confusing because while refactoring this code we could replace
    +    some "close_file=0" with "no_free=1", whereas others need to set both
    +    flags.
    +
    +    This is because there were some cases where an existing "close_file=0"
    +    meant "let's defer deallocation", and others where it meant "we don't
    +    want to close this file handle at all".
