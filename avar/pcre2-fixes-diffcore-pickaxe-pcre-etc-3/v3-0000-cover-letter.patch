    -    xdiff-interface: allow early return from xdiff_emit_{line,hunk}_fn
    +    xdiff-interface: prepare for allowing early return
     
    -    Change the function prototype of xdiff_emit_{line,hunk}_fn to return
    -    an int instead of void. This will allow for returning early from hunk
    -    & diff consumers that want some of the data, but not all of it.
    +    Change the function prototype of xdiff_emit_line_fn to return an "int"
    +    instead of "void". Change all of those functions to "return 0",
    +    nothing checks those return values yet, and no behavior is being
    +    changed.
     
    -    No behavior is being changed here, just replacing the equivalent of
    -    "return" with "return 0", nothing acts on the changed return values
    -    yet.
    -
    -    There was some work in this area of xdiff-interface.[ch] recently with
    -    3b40a090fd4 (diff: avoid generating unused hunk header lines,
    -    2018-11-02) and 7c61e25fbf1 (diff: use hunk callback for word-diff,
    -    2018-11-02).
    -
    -    In combination those two changes allow us to not do any work on the
    -    hunks and diff at all, but didn't change the status quo with regards
    -    to consumers that e.g. want the diff lines, but might want to abort
    -    early.
    -
    -    Whereas soon we can abort e.g. on the first "-line" of a 1000 line
    -    diff if that's all we needed.
    -
    -    This interface is rather scary as noted in the comment to
    -    xdiff-interface.h being added here, but it will be useful for
    -    diffcore-pickaxe.c in a subsequent commit. A future change could
    -    e.g. add more exit codes, and hack xdl_emit_diff() and friends to
    -    ignore or skip things more selectively as a result.
    +    In subsequent commits the interface will be changed to allow early
    +    return via this new return value.

    -    xdiff-interface: support early exit in xdiff_outf()
    +    xdiff-interface: allow early return from xdiff_emit_line_fn
     
    -    Bridge the gap between the preceding "xdiff-interface: allow early
    -    return from xdiff_emit_{line,hunk}_fn" change and the public
    -    interface.
    +    Finish the change started in the preceding commit and allow an early
    +    return from "xdiff_emit_line_fn" callbacks, this will allows
    +    diffcore-pickaxe.c to save itself redundant work.
     
    -    This change was split off from the preceding commit as it wasn't a
    -    purely mechanical addition of "return 0".
    +    Our xdiff interface also had the limitation of not being able to abort
    +    early since the beginning, see d9ea73e0564 (combine-diff: refactor
    +    built-in xdiff interface., 2006-04-05). Although at that time
    +    "xdiff_emit_line_fn" was called "xdiff_emit_consume_fn", and
    +    "xdiff_emit_hunk_fn" didn't exist yet.
     
    -    Here we want to be able to abort early, but do so in a way that
    -    doesn't skip the appropriate strbuf_reset() invocations.
    +    There was some work in this area of xdiff-interface.[ch] recently with
    +    3b40a090fd4 (diff: avoid generating unused hunk header lines,
    +    2018-11-02) and 7c61e25fbf1 (diff: use hunk callback for word-diff,
    +    2018-11-02).
    +
    +    In combination those two changes allow us to not do any work on the
    +    hunks and diff at all, but didn't change the status quo with regards
    +    to consumers that e.g. want the diff lines, but might want to abort
    +    early.
    +
    +    Whereas now we can abort e.g. on the first "-line" of a 1000 line diff
    +    if that's all we needed.
    +
    +    This interface is rather scary as noted in the comment to
    +    xdiff-interface.h being added here, as noted there a future change
    +    could add more exit codes, and hack xdl_emit_diff() and friends to
    +    ignore or skip things more selectively as a result.
    +
    +    I did not see an inherent reason for why xdl_emit_{diffrec,record}()
    +    could not be changed to ferry the "xdiff_emit_line_fn" error code
    +    upwards instead of returning -1 on all "ret < 0".
     
    -    The use of -1 as a return value is consistent with the rest of the
    -    xdiff codebase, where doing so signals an abort or error that'll
    -    propagate up the stack.
    +    But doing so would require corresponding changes in xdl_emit_diff(),
    +    xdl_diff(). I didn't see any issue with narrowly doing that to
    +    accomplish what I needed here, but it would leave xdiff's own return
    +    values in an inconsistent state.
    +
    +    Instead I've left it at returning a more conventional (for git's own
    +    codebase) 1 for an early return, and translating it (or rather, all
    +    non-zero) to -1 for xdiff's consumption.
    +
    +    The reason for most of the "stop" complexity in xdiff_outf() is
    +    because we want to be able to abort early, but do so in a way that
    +    doesn't skip the appropriate strbuf_reset() invocations.
