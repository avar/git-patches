    @@ Commit message
         "COPYING" as test data, or mock data that's dissimilar. Let's provide
         that with a "COPYING_test_data" function instead.
     
    +    We're not replacing this with some other generic test
    +    data (e.g. "lorum ipsum") because these tests require test file header
    +    to be the old "COPYING" file. See e.g. "t4003-diff-rename-1.sh" which
    +    changes the file, and then does full "test_cmp" comparisons on the
    +    resulting "git diff" output.

         This change only changes tests that used the "lib-diff.sh" library,
         but splits up what they need into a new "lib-diff-data.sh". A
         subsequent commit will change related tests that were missed in
