Subject: [PATCH 0/2] CI: don't fail OSX tests due to brew v.s. perforce.com mis-match
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

Junio: Despite modifying CI stuff this series merges cleanly with
"seen", and has no semantic conflicts with any outstanding CI changes.

For the past days we've again had CI failures due to "brew install"
detecting a SHA-256 mismatch when trying to install the perforce
package[1]. E.g. "seen" is now failing: https://github.com/git/git/runs/6104156856?check_suite_focus=true

This occurrence of this issue will no doubt be fixed within a few days
as the homebrew-cask repository is updated, i.e. this recipe:
https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/commits/master/Casks/perforce.rb

But for our CI usage being this anal about the check isn't worth it,
here's a passing CI run where we simply forced the installation:
https://github.com/avar/git/runs/6092916675?check_suite_focus=true#step:3:87
and subsequently passed the git-p4 tests:
https://github.com/avar/git/runs/6092916675?check_suite_focus=true#step:4:1678

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (2):
  CI: run "brew install perforce" without past workarounds
  CI: don't care about SHA256 mismatch on upstream "perforce" package
