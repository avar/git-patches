Subject: [PATCH v2 0/3] object-name: make ambiguous object output translatable + show tag date
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This topic improves the output we emit on ambiguous objects as noted
in 3/3, and makes it translatable. See [3] for v3.

The only changes since v3 are minor commit message improvements
spotted while re-rolling this. I think revewers were happy with it in
v3, but it fell through the cracks.
