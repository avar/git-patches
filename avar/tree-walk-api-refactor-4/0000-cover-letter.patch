Subject: [PATCH v4 00/29] tree-walk: mostly replace "mode" with "enum object_type"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

A re-roll of v3 of this series[1] and on top of (and requires) my
just-submitted v5 re-roll of the read_tree() refactoring series[2].

There was a regression in 1/32 of the old series. Removing the
canon_mode() call in diff.c didn't account for us needing to
canonicalize "diff --no-index" modes. There were no tests for this,
and it failed or not depending on the FS modes in the git.git checkout
being tested. This fixes the CI smoke coming from this series.

I plan to submit another set of patches to fix git diff --no-index's
test coverage, but for this series it was best to just eject it.

I'm confident that this is in a good shape now. There is now no
canon_mode() change in this series, just refactoring of
s/mode/object_type/g.

As discussed in earlier rounds the point of this prep series is to get
to a point where we can expose an API to fix long-standin blindspots
in fsck checks.

This is a long journey to get to that point, and isn't strictly
necessary to fix tht issue. But I think it's worth it since it leaves
the API use in a much better state where it's clear which things
actually require the mode bits, and which are just asking about the
object type of tree entries.

I dropped a couple of more patches to do with archive.c, in my
re-rolled [2] I'm now dealing with the "stage" parameter there, so
there's no need to do that here anymore.
