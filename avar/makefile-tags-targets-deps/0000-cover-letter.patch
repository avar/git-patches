Subject: [PATCH 0/3] Makefile: "make tags" fixes & cleanup
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

A small series to fix the various "tags" targets, i.e. "make tags TAGS
cscope". We'll now properly detect their dependencies, so we don't
needlessly run them every time. I have this as part of my standard
"make git" command, so doing nothing when we have nothing to do is
preferrable, especially when my editor will eagerly reload the TAGS
file every time it changes.

As noted in 3/3 this is better on top of my just-submitted
.DELETE_ON_ERROR change[1], but will also work independently of that
patch/series.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (3):
  Makefile: move ".PHONY: cscope" near its target
  Makefile: fix "cscope" target to refer to cscope.out
  Makefile: don't use "FORCE" for tags targets
