Subject: [PATCH v4 0/7] test-lib tests: split off subtest code in t0000 into lib-subtest.sh
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

A re-roll of v3[1] of this cleanup/refactoring of t0000-basic.sh
series which addresses Carlo's comments on it, thanks for the review
Carlo!

I.e. the old 3/9 is squashed into a 2/7, and the assertion of
non-duplicate tests is now ejected. I left a note in 7/7 that we may
want it in the future, but for now let's punt on it.

  test-lib tests: move "run_sub_test" to a new lib-subtest.sh
  test-lib tests: split up "write and run" into two functions
  test-lib tests: don't provide a description for the sub-tests
  test-lib tests: avoid subshell for "test_cmp" for readability
  test-lib tests: refactor common part of check_sub_test_lib_test*()
  test-lib tests: assert 1 exit code, not non-zero
  test-lib tests: get rid of copy/pasted mock test code

         it possible to do so. All the changes in t0000-basic.sh are a simple
         search-replacement.
     
    +    Since the _run_sub_test_lib_test_common() function doesn't handle
    +    running the test anymore we can do away with the sub-shell, which was
    +    used to scope an "unset" and "export" shell variables.

         run_sub_test_lib_test*() functions let's fix those tests in
         t0000-basic.sh that were verbosely copy/pasting earlier tests.
     
    -    In a subsequent commit we'll add an assertion to check whether we
    -    caught all of the copy/pasting.
    +    That we caught all of them was asserted with a follow-up change that's
    +    not part of this series[1], we might add such a duplication check at
    +    some later time, but for now let's just one-off remove the duplicate
