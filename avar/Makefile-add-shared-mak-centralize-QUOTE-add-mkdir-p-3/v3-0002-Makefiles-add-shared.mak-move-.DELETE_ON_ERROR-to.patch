Subject: [PATCH v3 2/9] Makefiles: add "shared.mak", move ".DELETE_ON_ERROR"
 to it
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

We have various behavior that's shared across our Makefiles, or that
really should be (e.g. via defined templates). Let's create a
top-level "shared.mak" to house those sorts of things, and start by
adding the ".DELETE_ON_ERROR" flag to it.

See my own 7b76d6bf221 (Makefile: add and use the ".DELETE_ON_ERROR"
flag, 2021-06-29) and db10fc6c09f (doc: simplify Makefile using
.DELETE_ON_ERROR, 2021-05-21) for the addition and use of the
".DELETE_ON_ERROR" flag.

This does have the potential downside that if e.g. templates/Makefile
would like to include this "shared.mak" in the future the semantics of
such a Makefile will change, but as noted in the above commits (and
GNU make's own documentation) any such change would be for the better,
so it's safe to do this.

This also doesn't introduce a bug by e.g. having this
".DELETE_ON_ERROR" flag only apply to this new shared.mak, Makefiles
have no such scoping semantics.
