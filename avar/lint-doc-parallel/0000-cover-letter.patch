Subject: [PATCH 0/4] doc lint: fix recent regression, make non-.PHONY
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Recent patches of mine broke the "check-docs" target by using
;-chaining instead of &&-chaining, d'oh! That's currently hiding a
breakage in "seen"[1], sorry!

In 1/4 that's fixed, 2/4 emits errors to STDERR instead of STDOUT, 3/4
speeds up the target by ~2x by skipping unnecessary work, and 4/4
makes it non-.PHONY.

The technique in 4/4 of exhaustively generating a dependency graph
per-file is something I'm also using in some yet-to-be-submitted
series of other Makefile fixes, that similarly speed things up.
