Subject: [PATCH 0/8] Makefile: generate a hook-list.h, prep for config-based-hooks
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This series is an incremental restart of the es/config-based-hooks and
ab/config-based-hooks-base topics, which should both be ejected in
favor of this.

Those topics have been lingering for a long time. The v5 of
ab/config-based-hooks-base[1] was re-rolled on September 2nd, and then
on September 9th I re-rolled a v4 of Emily's on-top topic[2] to solve
conflicts with the "base" one as other things in "seen" were colliding
with its v4 + Emily's older version.

But in the end the sum total of master..es/config-based-hooks is 43
commits and a rather daunting "44 files changed, 1870 insertions(+),
611 deletions(-)" diffstat. I think it's fair to say that anything
approaching a full picture of these patches only exists in our
respective wetwares, and wider reviewer attention is clearly needed.

That much larger topic also has a conflict Junio's been solving, and
by its presence has surely been holding up the progression of various
other submitted and unsubmitted topics.

So this is step #1 in an (at least) 5 step plan outlined in [3] (start
reading at "It seems due to") to get this greater series into git in a
more piecemeal fashion.

Emily Shaffer (1):
  hook.c: add a hook_exists() wrapper and use it in bugreport.c

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (7):
  Makefile: mark "check" target as .PHONY
  Makefile: stop hardcoding {command,config}-list.h
  Makefile: don't perform "mv $@+ $@" dance for $(GENERATED_H)
  Makefile: remove an out-of-date comment
  hook.[ch]: move find_hook() from run-command.c to hook.c
  hook.c users: use "hook_exists()" instead of "find_hook()"
  hook-list.h: add a generated list of hooks, like config-list.h
