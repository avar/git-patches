Minor cleanups thath would semantically & textually conflict with
Taylor's
https://lore.kernel.org/git/cover.1652915424.git.me@ttaylorr.com/; but
which I noted while reading through it.

The 2/2 here is something I wrote before spotting
https://lore.kernel.org/git/1d775f9850f00b0c3d1e9133669a6365c8d7bbba.1652915424.git.me@ttaylorr.com/;
which does pretty much the same thing. but IMO it's better to put this
in hash.h than chunk-format.h.

The 1/2 then fixes the minor NEEDSWORK in that series:
https://lore.kernel.org/git/8f9fd21be9fcdda5c73d800fc66d1087d61a6888.1652915424.git.me@ttaylorr.com/

All of this can be ignored for now, I can submit it after cruft packs
land (if I remember), or if Taylor's interested in picking it up in
some way...

But I figured it was useful to send it along in liue of "maybe do it
this way" (2/2) or "can we just create a utility function for this?"
(1/2) comments on the series itself.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (2):
  packfile API: add and use a pack_name_to_ext() utility function
  hash API: add and use a hash_short_id_by_algo() function
