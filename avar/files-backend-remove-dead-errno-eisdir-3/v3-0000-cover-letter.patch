hopefully addressing all the comments by Peff & Junio, thanks
both!

Changes:

 * Lots of commit message/comment changes, see range-diff

 * I referred to an assert() I forgot to add, the series now juggles
   an assert() of thei oid back and forth, for clarity of what we're
   actually doing.

   As noted in v2 I've got a series prepped for this one to finally
   clean up those loose ends/dead code, but let's focus on the
   behavior changes for now.

 * There's now a 12th patch to remove the "ENOTDIR" case Peff noted,

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (12):
  refs/packet: add missing BUG() invocations to reflog callbacks
  refs/files: remove unused REF_DELETING in lock_ref_oid_basic()
  refs/files: remove unused "extras/skip" in lock_ref_oid_basic()
  refs/files: remove unused "skip" in lock_raw_ref() too
  refs/debug: re-indent argument list for "prepare"
  refs API: pass the "lock OID" to reflog "prepare"
  refs: make repo_dwim_log() accept a NULL oid
  refs/files: add a comment about refs_reflog_exists() call
  reflog expire: don't lock reflogs using previously seen OID
  refs/files: remove unused "oid" in lock_ref_oid_basic()
  refs/files: remove unused "errno == EISDIR" code
  refs/files: remove unused "errno != ENOTDIR" condition

         refs/files: remove unused REF_DELETING in lock_ref_oid_basic()
     
    -    The lock_ref_oid_basic() function has gradually been replaced by use
    -    of the file transaction API, there are only 4 remaining callers of
    -    it.
    -
    -    None of those callers pass REF_DELETING, the last such caller went
    -    away in 8df4e511387 (struct ref_update: move "have_old" into "flags",
    -    2015-02-17). This is the start of even more removal of unused code in
    -    and around this function.
    +    The lock_ref_oid_basic() function has gradually been by most callers
    +    no longer performing a low-level "acquire lock, update and release",
    +    and instead using the ref transaction API. So there are only 4
    +    remaining callers of lock_ref_oid_basic().
    +
    +    None of those callers pass REF_DELETING anymore, the last caller went
    +    away in 92b1551b1d (refs: resolve symbolic refs first,
    +    2016-04-25).
    +
    +    Before that we'd refactored and moved this code in:
    +
    +     - 8df4e511387 (struct ref_update: move "have_old" into "flags",
    +       2015-02-17)
    +
    +     - 7bd9bcf372d (refs: split filesystem-based refs code into a new
    +       file, 2015-11-09)
    +
    +     - 165056b2fc (lock_ref_for_update(): new function, 2016-04-24)
    +
    +    We then finally stopped using it in 92b1551b1d (noted above). So let's
    +    remove the handling of this parameter.
    +
    +    By itself this change doesn't benefit us much, but it's the start of
    +    even more removal of unused code in and around this function in
    +    subsequent commits.

         In the preceding commit the last caller that passed a non-NULL OID was
         changed to pass NULL to lock_ref_oid_basic(). As noted in preceding

         condition, and therefore anything except the "flags =

    -    function we called did most of its work when the "oid" was passed (as
