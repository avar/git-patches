Subject: [PATCH 0/3] bundle-uri: "dumb" static CDN offloading, spec & server implementation
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This implements a new "bundle-uri" protocol v2 extension, which allows
servers to advertise *.bundle files which clients can pre-seed their
full "clone"'s or incremental "fetch"'s from.

This is both an alternative to, and complimentary to the existing
"packfile-uri" mechanism, i.e. servers and/or clients can pick one or
both, but would generally pick one over the other.

This "bundle-uri" mechanism has the advantage of being dumber, and
offloads more complexity from the server side to the client
side.

Unlike with packfile-uri a conforming server doesn't need produce a
PACK that (hopefully, otherwise there's not much point) excludes OIDs
that it knows it'll provide via a packfile-uri.

To the server a "bundle-uri" negotiation the same as a "normal" one,
the client just happens to provide OIDs it found in bundles as "have"
lines.

In my WIP client patches I even have a (trivial to implement) mode
where a client can choose to pretend that a server reported that a
given set of bundle URIs can be used to pre-seed its "clone" or
"fetch".

A client can thus use use a CDN it controls to optimistically pre-seed
a clone from a server that knows nothing about "bundle-uri", sort of
like a "git clone --reference <path> --dissociate", except with a
<uri> instead of a <path>.

Need re-clone a bunch of large repositories on CI boxes from
git.example.com, but git.example.com doesn't support "bundle-uri", and
you've got a slow outbound connection? Just point to a pre-seeding CDN
you control.

There are disadvantages to this over packfile-uri, JGit has a mature
implementation of it, and I doubt that e.g. Google will ever want to
use this, since that feature was tailor-made for their use case.

E.g. a repository that has a *.pack sitting on disk can't re-use and
stream it out with sendfile() as it could with a "packfile-uri",
instead it would need to point to some duplicate of that data in
*.bundle form (or on-the-fly generate a header for the *.pack).

The goal of this feature isn't to win over packfile-uri users, but to
give users who wouldn't consider it due to its tight coupling to have
access to CDN offloading.

The error optimistic recovery of "bundle-uri" and looseer coupling
between server and CDN means that it should be easy to use this for
use where the CDN is something like say Debian's mirror network.

We're coming up on 2.34.0-rc0, so this certainly won't be in 2.34.0,
but I'm submitting this now per discussion during '#git-devel' standup
today.

There was a discussion on the RFC version of the larger series of
patches to implement this "bundle-uri"[1].

I've updated the protocol-v2.txt changes in 2/3 a lot in response to
that, in particular I've specified and implemented early client
disconnection behavior, so bundle-uri SHOULD never cause
client<->server dialog to hang (at most we'll need to re-connect, if
we need to fall back from a failed bundle-uri).
