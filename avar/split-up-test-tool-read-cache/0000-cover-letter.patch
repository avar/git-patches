Subject: [PATCH 0/4] test-tool: split up "read-cache" tool
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

When the sparse index topic was being discussed I suggested that the
t/helper/read-cache.c tool was getting to the point of doing too many
things and should be split up.

Since that series has landed on master here's that suggestion again in
the form of patches on top of master. The 4/4 patch is a "while I was
at it" addition of an extra perf test for index refreshing.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (4):
  test-tool: split up test-tool read-cache
  test-tools: migrate read-cache-perf to parse_options()
  test-tools: migrate read-cache-again to parse_options()
  read-cache perf: add a perf test for refresh_index()
