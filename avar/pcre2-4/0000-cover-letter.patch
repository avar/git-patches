Subject: [PATCH v4 00/19] PCRE v1 improvements & PCRE v2 support
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Trivial changes since last time. Just sending this because I'd like
the copy in pu updated. Changes noted below:

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (19):
  grep: amend submodule recursion test in preparation for rx engine
    testing
  grep: add tests for grep pattern types being passed to submodules

A s/PCRE/LIBPCRE/ on the test_have_prereq, now makes sense with the
series in sequence (error added during rebasing).

  grep: submodule-related case statements should die if new fields are
    added
  grep: remove redundant regflags assignment under PCRE
  grep: remove redundant `regflags &= ~REG_EXTENDED` assignments

NEW: Similarly to how we didn't need to set regflags under PCRE, we
were negating REG_EXTENDED under POSIX basic, without ever setting it
in the first place.

This was just as confusing as the PCRE oddity, so remove it.

  Makefile & configure: reword outdated comment about PCRE
  grep: add a test for backreferences in PCRE patterns
  log: add exhaustive tests for pattern style options & config
  log: add -P as a synonym for --perl-regexp
  grep & rev-list doc: stop promising libpcre for --perl-regexp
  grep: make grep.patternType=[pcre|pcre1] a synonym for "perl"
  test-lib: rename the LIBPCRE prerequisite to PCRE

One corresponding s/LIBPCRE/PCRE/ for the earlier change, see above.

  grep: change the internal PCRE macro names to be PCRE1
  grep: change the internal PCRE code & header names to be PCRE1
  perf: add a performance comparison test of grep -E and -P
  grep: add support for the PCRE v1 JIT API
  grep: add support for PCRE v2

We now give proper error messages via pcre2_get_error_message() when
pcre2_match() fails with errors other than "didn't match", the common
case for this is that the engine gave up on a pathological pattern /
input combination.

  grep: remove support for concurrent use of both PCRE v1 & v2
  Makefile & configure: make PCRE v2 the default PCRE implementation

Added more details to the commit message about why switching to PCRE
v2 by default is a good idea. I hadn't noticed before that deep bugs
in PCRE v1 are being WONTFIX'd on the bugtracker saying "nope, never
fixing thath in v1, switch to v2".
