Subject: [PATCH 0/2] proc.5: note broken v4.18 userspace promise
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Along with a trivial change in 1/2 (which would otherwise textually
conflict) this 2/2 notes that since Linux 4.18 the promise that the
"comm" field in /proc/PID/stat will be no longer than 15 characters
hasn't been true for the "kworker" processes.

This caveat was noted in a discussion on HN
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34093845;

I myself have code in git/git@2d3491b117c (tr2: log N parent process
names on Linux, 2021-08-27) which won't do anything bad if this were
to be combined with PID recycling (with a kernel thread usurping the
PID of a process that used to belong to our parent), but it will
behave unexpectedly. I wrote that code against the promises made in
proc(5) at the time.

As I'm about to send this I notice that [1] was sent yesterday, which
textually conflicts with this submission[1]. I've added its authors to
the CC (I'm not on the linux-man list).

Personally I never read the note that the "comm" string would be
contained in parentheses as a promise that the kernel was going to
strip ")" from userspace names, or only allow balanced parentheses or
whatever, but perhaps it's useful to include such a blurb for those
who didn't think of that edge case.

But I think the fix here is more important, as we're currently making
promises about the length of these strings that haven't been true
since v4.18.

  proc.5: note that "cmdline" might be favored over "stat.comm" by ps(1)
  proc.5: the "comm" field can be longer than 16 bytes
