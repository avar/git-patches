Subject: [PATCH 0/5] cache API: always have a "istate->repo"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The "struct index_state" contains a "repo" member, which should be a
pointer to the repository for that index, but which due to us
constructing such structs on an ad-hoc basis in various places wasn't
always available.

We'd thus end up with code like this, in the recent
ds/omit-trailing-hash-in-index topic:

	struct repository *r = istate->repo ? istate->repo : the_repository;

Really we should be able to trust the "istate->repo", but were
carrying those sorts of conditionals because our index might come from
a manually constructed source, so we'd have to fall back to
"the_repository".

This series changes the relvant code so the "repo" field is always
non-NULL, as 5/5 here shows we had various workarounds in place for
that, which can now go away.

See
https://github.com/avar/git/tree/avar/do-not-lazy-populate-istate-repo
for passing CI and a fetchable branch for this topic.

See https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqqmt6vqo2w.fsf@gitster.g/ for
previous discussion on this topic.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (5):
  builtin/difftool.c: { 0 }-initialize rather than using memset()
  sparse-index.c: expand_to_path() can assume non-NULL "istate"
  sparse-index API: fix TODO, BUG() out on NULL ensure_full_index()
  read-cache.c: refactor set_new_index_sparsity() for subsequent commit
  treewide: always have a valid "index_state.repo" member
