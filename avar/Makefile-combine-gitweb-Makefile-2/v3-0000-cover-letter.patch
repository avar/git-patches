Subject: [PATCH v3 0/8] gitweb: fix "make" not including "gitweb" without NOOP run slowdowns
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The $subject is a mostly trivial re-roll of
https://lore.kernel.org/git/cover-v2-0.7-00000000000-20220531T173805Z-avarab@gmail.com/.

Changes since v3:

 * Correct the commit message of 7/8 to account for SZEDER's commit
   being included in this (that part was also incorrect in v2).

 * As noted in
   https://lore.kernel.org/git/220624.86bkuikidi.gmgdl@evledraar.gmail.com/
   I went over various git packages in the wild to see if my changes
   here would break things

   I did find that not having a wrapper gitweb/Makefile would break
   OpenBSD's package, but it's a one-line fix.

   But to make up for it I saw that a semi-common pattern was to
   manually munge our Makefile to get rid of "gitweb" or
   "gitweb-install" targets. All of {Free,Net,Dragonfly}BSD were doing
   that. They'll now happily be able to use a NO_GITWEB=Y flag
   instead, so hopefully the small amount of disruption here makes up
   for itself.

SZEDER Gábor (1):
  Makefile: build 'gitweb' in the default target

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (7):
  gitweb/Makefile: define all .PHONY prerequisites inline
  gitweb/Makefile: add a $(GITWEB_ALL) variable
  gitweb/Makefile: clear up and de-duplicate the gitweb.{css,js} vars
  gitweb/Makefile: prepare to merge into top-level Makefile
  gitweb: remove "test" and "test-installed" targets
  gitweb/Makefile: include in top-level Makefile
  gitweb/Makefile: add a "NO_GITWEB" parameter

    @@ Commit message
         Since then a simple 'make' doesn't build 'gitweb'.
     
         Luckily, installing 'gitweb' is not broken: although 'make install'
    -    doesn't depend on the 'gitweb' target, it runs 'make -C gitweb
    -    install' unconditionally, which does generate all the necessary files
    +    doesn't depend on the 'gitweb' target, it has a dependency on the
    +    'install-gitweb' target, which does generate all the necessary files
         for 'gitweb' and installs them.  However, if someone runs 'make &&
         sudo make install', then those files in the 'gitweb' directory will be
         generated and owned by root, which is not nice.
