Subject: [PATCH 0/5] config: support --type=bool-or-auto for "tristate" parsing
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Refactor some of our internal C code to use a new
git_config_tristate() functino instead of checking for "auto" or
"bool" in several places.

This isn't just Yet Another Ævar Series, I'm using this to re-roll my
outstanding userdiff series, the start of that topic was a partial
refactor of userdiff.c which is better done here.

While writing this I discovered that the recently added --bool-or-type
option added in
https://lore.kernel.org/git/pull.781.v18.git.git.1599895268433.gitgitgadget@gmail.com/
didn't have any tests (and we didn't notice in 18! iterations of it:)

2/5 adds that, 1/5 adds a comment on some bool parsing code that's
puzzled me for the Nth time.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (5):
  config.c: add a comment about why value=NULL is true
  config tests: test for --bool-or-str
  git-config: document --bool-or-str and --type=bool-or-str
  config.c: add a "tristate" helper
  config: add --type=bool-or-auto switch
