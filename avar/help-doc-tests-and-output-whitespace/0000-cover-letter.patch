Subject: [PATCH 0/7] help: test and fix small "help -g" regression
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Fix a trivial regression in 17b3e515050 (Merge branch
'nd/command-list' into nd/complete-config-vars, 2018-05-29) where we'd
overly whitespace pad "git help -g", since the codepath moved to a
function that assumed it needed to "\n\n"-pad multiple items being
emitted, so we'd print an extra leading newline when printing one
item (as opposed to "git help -a").

In doing so I wanted to add regression tests, and to do that we first
need to make the format stable ("git help -a" will change depending on
whatever git-* you have in $PATH).

These are things I noticed when re-rolling my no-yet-picked-up series
to move Documentation/technical/* to manpages[1]. An unsubmitted
re-roll of this series depends on this one. I'll hold off on a
re-submission of it until this series has graduated.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (7):
  help doc: add missing "]" to "[-a|--all]"
  help.c: use puts() instead of printf{,_ln}() for consistency
  help tests: test "git" and "git help [-a|-g] spacing
  help.c: split up list_all_cmds_help() function
  help: error if [-a|-g|-c] and [-i|-m|-w] are combined
  help: add --no-[external-commands|aliases] for use with --all
  help: don't print "\n" before single-section output
