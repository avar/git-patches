Subject: [PATCH v3 00/30] Easy to review grep & pre-PCRE changes
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Easy to review? 29 (I mean 30) patches? Are you kidding me?!

As noted in v1 (<20170511091829.5634-1-avarab@gmail.com>;
https://public-inbox.org/git/20170511091829.5634-1-avarab@gmail.com/)
these are all doc, test, refactoring etc. changes needed by the
subsequent "PCRE v2, PCRE v1 JIT, log -P & fixes" series.

Since Junio hasn't been picking it I'm no longer sending updates to
that patch series & waiting for this one to cook first.

See <20170513231509.7834-1-avarab@gmail.com>
(https://public-inbox.org/git/20170513231509.7834-1-avarab@gmail.com/)
for v2 & notes about that version. What changed this time around? See
below:

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (30):
  Makefile & configure: reword inaccurate comment about PCRE
  grep & rev-list doc: stop promising libpcre for --perl-regexp
  test-lib: rename the LIBPCRE prerequisite to PCRE

No changes.

  log: add exhaustive tests for pattern style options & config

Test comment clarifications in t4202-log.sh as pointed out by Junio.

  log: make --regexp-ignore-case work with --perl-regexp

NEW: I noticed that the `-i` in `git log --perl-regexp -i --grep=<rx>`
never worked as intended. I.e. the flag for ignoring the case of the
pattern wasn't picked up.

Fixing this was trivial (one-line change), so I've included it in this
series since it's needed by a new t/perf patch (see below).

  grep: add a test asserting that --perl-regexp dies when !PCRE
  grep: add a test for backreferences in PCRE patterns
  grep: change non-ASCII -i test to stop using --debug
  grep: add tests for --threads=N and grep.threads
  grep: amend submodule recursion test for regex engine testing
  grep: add tests for grep pattern types being passed to submodules

No changes.

  grep: add a test helper function for less verbose -f \0 tests

Trivial style changes in nul_match() suggested by Junio. No functional
changes.

  grep: prepare for testing binary regexes containing rx metacharacters

No changes.

  grep: add tests to fix blind spots with \0 patterns

Continued trivial style changes in nul_match() (the other half of the
code in that function is added in this commit)>

  perf: add a GIT_PERF_MAKE_COMMAND for when *_MAKE_OPTS won't do
  perf: emit progress output when unpacking & building

No changes.

  perf: add a comparison test of grep regex engines
  perf: add a comparison test of grep regex engines with -F
  perf: add a comparison test of log --grep regex engines

The log --grep test is new, and all these tests learned to take an env
variable to pass arbitrary extra grep/log flags, so I can e.g. test
with -i, -v, -w etc.

Subsequent commit messages that e.g. mentioned perf tests with the
previous hardcoded -i test have been amended to mention the new test
results.

  grep: catch a missing enum in switch statement

Grammar fix in commit message.

  grep: remove redundant regflags assignments

The two commits that made changes to regflags assignments have been
squashed.

  grep: factor test for \0 in grep patterns into a function

Rewrote commit message to not go off on a tangent about what grep -f
[file-with-\0-pattern] should mean, which is not what this change is
about.

  grep: change the internal PCRE macro names to be PCRE1
  grep: change internal *pcre* variable & function names to be *pcre1*
  grep: move is_fixed() earlier to avoid forward declaration
  test-lib: add a PTHREADS prerequisite

No changes.

  pack-objects & index-pack: add test for --threads warning
  pack-objects: fix buggy warning about threads

Rewrote the tests in these two so that the first one sets up a failing
test which is subsequently fixed in the commit that fixes the bug, as
suggested by Junio.

Removed a stray `cat err` left over from debugging.

  grep: given --threads with NO_PTHREADS=YesPlease, warn
  grep: assert that threading is enabled when calling grep_{lock,unlock}

No changes.
