Great, now that the base of this is migrating to next, here's the
second part of this.

For v1 see <20170513234535.12749-1-avarab@gmail.com>
(https://public-inbox.org/git/20170513234535.12749-1-avarab@gmail.com/).

The only changes to the content are better if/else branching around
conditional macros (but no functional changes) in the PCRE v1 JIT API
patch in response to a comment by Simon Ruderich.

The only other changes are trivial updates to the commit messages to
account for t/perf changes made in the series this builds on.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (7):
  grep: don't redundantly compile throwaway patterns under threading
  grep: skip pthreads overhead when using one thread
  log: add -P as a synonym for --perl-regexp
  grep: add support for the PCRE v1 JIT API
  grep: un-break building with PCRE < 8.32
  grep: un-break building with PCRE < 8.20
  grep: add support for PCRE v2
