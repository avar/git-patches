Subject: [PATCH v2 0/9] leak tests: mark more tests as passing
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This goes on top of the now-landed ab/sanitize-leak-ci and marks more
tests as passing.

The changes since v1 are to address commit a message nit
(s/whitelisted/listed/g), and I ejected the marking of
"t7812-grep-icase-non-ascii.sh" as passing, since this in combination
with 55dbc6f9987 (grep: fix an edge case concerning ascii patterns and
UTF-8 data, 2021-10-07) in "seen would cause it to fail. I don't think
that's a "real" failure, just a new test using a command that happens
to leak, but let's just skip it for now, we can mark it later after
those leaks are fixed.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (9):
  leak tests: run various built-in tests in t00*.sh SANITIZE=leak
  leak tests: run various "test-tool" tests in t00*.sh SANITIZE=leak
  leak tests: mark all ls-tree tests as passing with SANITIZE=leak
  leak tests: mark all trace2 tests as passing with SANITIZE=leak
  leak tests: mark all checkout-index tests as passing with
    SANITIZE=leak
  leak tests: mark some ls-files tests as passing with SANITIZE=leak
  leak tests: mark some read-tree tests as passing with SANITIZE=leak
  leak tests: mark various "generic" tests as passing with SANITIZE=leak
  leak tests: mark some misc tests as passing with SANITIZE=leak
