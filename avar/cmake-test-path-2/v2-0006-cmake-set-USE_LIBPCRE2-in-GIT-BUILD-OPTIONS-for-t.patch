Subject: [PATCH v2 06/11] cmake: set "USE_LIBPCRE2" in "GIT-BUILD-OPTIONS" for
 test-lib.sh
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

When we build with libpcre2 which cmake has supported since [1] we
need to set "USE_LIBPCRE2='YesPlease'" (or similar) in
"GIT-BUILD-OPTIONS".

Without this e.g. t7810-grep.sh will fail, as it has tests that rely
on the behavior of !PCRE2. The reason this hasn't been noticed is that
the Windows CI doesn't have access to libpcre2.

With this the remaining two failures we had left after the preceding
step are resolved, but note that that test run didn't include the
git-p4 tests, which a subsequent commit will address).

1. 80431510a2b (cmake: add pcre2 support, 2022-05-24)
