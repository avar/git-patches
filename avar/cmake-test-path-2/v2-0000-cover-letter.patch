         cmake: chmod +x the bin-wrappers/* & SCRIPT_{SH,PERL} & git-p4
     
    -    The cmake recipe added in [1] did not create the bin-wrappers/*
    -    directory, and thus fell back on running the tests with the equivalent
    -    of "--no-bin-wrappers".
    +    Since the cmake file was made to run on *nix in [1] running the tests
    +    with "ctest" broken, because we'd attempt to invoke our bin-wrappers/,
    +    but they didn't have the executable bit.
     
    -    Thus the. "t/test-lib.sh" would be unable to find "bin-wrappers/git",
    -    and we'd fall back on "GIT_EXEC_PATH=$GIT_BUILD_DIR" using the
    -    fallback behavior added in [2]:
    +    In the best case, the "t/test-lib.sh" would be unable to find
    +    "bin-wrappers/git", and we'd fall back on
    +    "GIT_EXEC_PATH=$GIT_BUILD_DIR" using the fallback behavior added in
    +    [2]:
     
                 $ ./t0001-init.sh
                 <GIT_BUILD_DIR>/t/../contrib/buildsystems/out/bin-wrappers/git is not executable; using GIT_EXEC_PATH
     
    -    Or rather, this is what would have happened on *nix, but until [3]
    -    there wasn't any non-Windows support for "cmake". On Windows it didn't
    -    matter that the bin-wrappers weren't made executable, since there's no
    -    executable bit, instead the emulation layer looks at whether a file
    -    has a shebang.
    +    This was recently somewhat swept under the rug in [3], as ctest would
    +    run them with "--no-bin-wrappers". But still with [3], running e.g.:
     
    -    But with [3] we've effectively used the semi-equivalent of

    -    In addition, we'd fail any test that needed to invoke one of our built
    -    shell, perl or Python scripts on *nix. E.g. t0012-help.sh would fail
    -    on a test that tried to invoke "git web--browse". I.e. the equivalent
    -    of this (in the "out" directory) would happen:

 3:  addaf73992f !  5:  6387682db06 cmake & test-lib.sh: add a $GIT_SOURCE_DIR variable
    @@ Commit message
         recipe has needed to copy various assets to that
         "contrib/buildsystems/out" directory.
     
    -    Let's instead teach the test-lib.sh that there's such a thing as the
    -    "$GIT_SOURCE_DIR" distinct from the "$GIT_BUILD_DIR".
    +    But we've only been doing this for the subsets of tests that run on
    +    Windows, and which have otherwise been covered by that CI target. The
    +    CI target builds (among other things) with "-DPERL_TESTS=OFF
    +    -DPYTHON_TESTS=OFF -DCURL_NO_CURL_CMAKE=ON", see [1]. Furthermore, the
    +    CI isn't testing from the "contrib/buildsystems/out" directory,
    +    instead it clobbers the top-level MAkefile.
    +
    +    There was a recent commit to fix a subset of these issues, see
    +    6a83b5f0810 (cmake: copy the merge tools for testing, 2022-10-18).
    +
    +    Let's stop going for that approach, and instead teach the test-lib.sh
    +    that there's such a thing as the "$GIT_SOURCE_DIR" distinct from the
    +    "$GIT_BUILD_DIR".
     
         Just as the "$TEST_DIRECTORY" always points to our actual "t"
         directory (not the "[...]/out/t" cmake creates), this new
         "$GIT_SOURCE_DIR" will always be the top-level source directory.
     
    -    So even though the "GIT_BUILD_DIR=(.*)" line in t/test-lib.sh will
    -    still be altered by CMakeLists.txt, that recipe will no longer need to
    -    copy over various things from our source directory, as the tests now
    -    know where to find those assets.
    +    With this change we now pass 3/5 of the tests that we still had
    +    failing with the fixes in the preceding commit.
