Subject: [PATCH v2 09/11] cmake: support GIT_TEST_OPTS, abstract away WIN32
 defaults
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The rationale for adding "--no-bin-wrappers" and "--no-chain-lint" in
2ea1d8b5563 (cmake: make it easier to diagnose regressions in CTest
runs, 2022-10-18) was those options slowed down the tests considerably
on Windows.

But since f31b6244950 (Merge branch 'yw/cmake-updates', 2022-06-07)
and with the preceding commits cmake and ctest are not
Windows-specific anymore.

So let's set those same options by default on Windows, but do so with
the set() facility. As noted in cmake's documentation[1] this
integrates nicely with e.g. cmake-gui.

On *nix we don't set any custom options. The change in 2ea1d8b5563
didn't discuss why Windows should have divergent defaults with "cmake"
and "make", but such reasons presumably don't apply on *nix. I for one
am happy with the same defaults as the tests have when running via the
Makefile.

With the "message()" addition we'll emit this when running cmake:

	Generating hook-list.h
	-- Using user-selected test options: -vixd
	-- Configuring done
	-- Generating done
	-- Build files have been written to: /home/avar/g/git/contrib/buildsystems/out

Unfortunately cmake doesn't support a non-hacky way to pass variables
to ctest without re-running cmake itself, so when re-running tests via
cmake and wanting to change the test defaults we'll need:

	GIT_TEST_OPTS=-i cmake -S contrib/buildsystems -B contrib/buildsystems/out &&
	ctest --jobs=$(nproc) --test-dir contrib/buildsystems/out -R t0071 --verbose
