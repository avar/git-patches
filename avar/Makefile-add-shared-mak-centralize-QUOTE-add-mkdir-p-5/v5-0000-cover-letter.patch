Subject: [PATCH v5 0/8] Makefile: optimize noop runs, add shared.mak
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

As the v1 notes (among other things):
https://lore.kernel.org/git/cover-0.8-00000000000-20211217T012902Z-avarab@gmail.com/

    This speeds up noop runs of "make" by a lot. After a "make" running a
    "make -j1" with this is ~1.5 faster than on "master"[2], and around 3x
    as fast with "make -j1 NO_TCLTK=Y" (the TCL part takes a lot of time,
    but that's another matter).

This v5 re-roll (for v3, see:
https://lore.kernel.org/git/cover-v4-0.9-00000000000-20220302T124320Z-avarab@gmail.com/):

 * Drops the "wspfx" patch.
 * Rephrases the 1/8 commit message, dropping the mention of .DEFAULT_GOAL etc.

  scalar Makefile: use "The default target of..." pattern
  Makefiles: add "shared.mak", move ".DELETE_ON_ERROR" to it
  Makefile: disable GNU make built-in wildcard rules
  Makefile: define $(LIB_H) in terms of $(FIND_SOURCE_FILES)
  Makefile: move ".SUFFIXES" rule to shared.mak
  Makefile: move $(comma), $(empty) and $(space) to shared.mak
  Makefile: add "$(QUIET)" boilerplate to shared.mak
  Makefiles: add and use wildcard "mkdir -p" template

    -    Make have the "contrib/scalar/Makefile" be stylistically consistent

    +    the top-level "Makefile" in first declaring "all" to be the default
    +    rule, followed by including other Makefile snippets.
     
         This adjusts code added in 0a43fb22026 (scalar: create a rudimentary
    -    executable, 2021-12-03), it's a style-only change, in a subsequent
    -    commit the "QUIET" boilerplate at the beginning of this file will be
    -    retrieved via an include, and having an "all:" between the two set of
    -    "include"'s after that change would look odd.
    -
    -    As noted in [1] using ".DEFAULT_GOAL = all" is another way to do this
    -    in more modern GNU make versions, which we already have a hard
    -    dependency on, but let's leave any such change for a future
    -    improvement and go with using our established pattern consistently for
    -    now.

    +    "include" file in a subsequent commit that the included file won't be
    +    the one to define our default target.
