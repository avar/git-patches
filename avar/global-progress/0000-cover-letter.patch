Subject: [PATCH 0/8] progress: assert "global_progress" + test fixes / cleanup
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

These patches were originally submitted as part of a much larger topic
at [1]. The add a "global_progress" "struct progress *" which we
assign/clear to as we start/stop progress bars.

This will become imporant for some new progress features I have
planend, but right now is just used to assert that we don't start two
progress bars at the same time. 7/8 fixes an existing bug where we did
that.

To get there I fixed up the test helper to be able to test this, moved
some code around, and fixes a couple of existing nits in 5/8 and 6/8..

See also [2] which is a re-submission of that larger topic, but the
two can proceed independently.
