Subject: [PATCH v6 6/8] pack-bitmap-write.c: don't return without
 stop_progress()
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Fix a bug that's been here since 7cc8f971085 (pack-objects: implement
bitmap writing, 2013-12-21), we did not call stop_progress() if we
reached the early exit in this function.

We could call stop_progress() before we return, but better yet is to
defer calling start_progress() until we need it.

This will matter in a subsequent commit where we BUG(...) out if this
happens, and matters now e.g. because we don't have a corresponding
"region_end" for the progress trace2 event.
