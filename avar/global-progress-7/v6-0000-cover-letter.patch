Subject: [PATCH v6 0/8] progress: assert "global_progress" + test fixes / cleanup
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

A minor but important fixup of v5[1], as pointed out by Carlo Arenas
the STDIN_FILENO I added in response to feedback in an earlier re-roll
had a pretty bad off-by-one bug.

As an aside that we have no tests for this code at all is pretty bad,
I'll try to address that separately from this series.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (8):
  leak tests: fix a memory leaks in "test-progress" helper
  progress.c test helper: add missing braces
  progress.c tests: make start/stop commands on stdin
  progress.c tests: test some invalid usage
  progress.c: add temporary variable from progress struct
  pack-bitmap-write.c: don't return without stop_progress()
  various *.c: use isatty(0|2), not isatty(STDIN_FILENO|STDERR_FILENO)
  progress.c: add & assert a "global_progress" variable
