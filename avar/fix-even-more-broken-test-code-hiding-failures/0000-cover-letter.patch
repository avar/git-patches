Subject: [PATCH 0/6] tests: fix ignored & hidden exit codes
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

A small set of fixes to correct git on the LHS of a pipe, and in $()
within a "test" expression, or where its exit code is otherwise
hidden.

This also includes a (reworded) version of a case where we exit'd out
of test-lib.sh itself, which Junio requested by spun off in:
https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqqmtd33e1h.fsf@gitster.g/

As noted in
https://lore.kernel.org/git/cover-v2-00.14-00000000000-20220720T211221Z-avarab@gmail.com/
there's no need to rebase the other series on top of this, it benefits
from 6/6 here, but the two can proceed independently.

This is still just the tip of the iceberg in terms of hidden exit
codes in the test suite, as can be seen with e.g.:

	git grep 'test.*\$\((git|test-tool)' -- 't/*.sh'

But these are all cases I've run into actual issues with, almost all
when testing with SANITIZE=leak. In most cases just with one of the
hunks in a given commit, but then I converted the rest of the file to
fix a similar bad pattern.

    @@ Commit message
         Using "exit 1" outside a sub-shell will cause the test framework
         itself to exit on failure, which isn't what we want to do here.
     
    -    This issue was spotted with the new
    -    "GIT_TEST_PASSING_SANITIZE_LEAK=check" mode, i.e. that "git show"
    -    command leaks memory, and we'd thus "exit 1". Another implementation
    -    of "GIT_TEST_PASSING_SANITIZE_LEAK=check" or "--invert-exit-code"
    -    might have intercepted the "exit 1", and thus hidden the underlying
    -    issue here, but we correctly distinguish the two.
    +    This issue was spotted with the in-flight
    +    "GIT_TEST_PASSING_SANITIZE_LEAK=check" test mode[1]. This "git show"
    +    invocation currently leaks memory, and we'd thus "exit 1". This change
    +    was initially part of that topic[2] to demonstrate the correctness of
    +    the "check" implementation.
