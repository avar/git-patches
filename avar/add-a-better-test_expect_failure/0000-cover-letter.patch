Subject: [PATCH 0/7] test-lib-functions: a better "test_expect_failure"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

As explained in detail in 1/7 there's several major shortcomings to
"test_expect_failure", this series adds a "test_expect_todo".

It allows us to assert exactly how something that fails .. fails (no
more conflating segfaults for "exit 1"), but also emits all the right
output & metadata about the test being "TODO" that
"test_expect_failure" does.

The rest of the series then expands on that to convert several more
tests, along with adding helpers like:

    todo_test_cmp want expect actual

Where the "want" is what we want once we'd mark the test as
"test_expect_success", but the "expect" is what we get right now with
the failing TODO test.

This series has a (rather trivial) textual conflict with
js/ci-github-workflow-markup in "seen".

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (7):
  test-lib: add a "test_expect_todo", similar to "test_expect_failure"
  test-lib-functions: add and use a "test_todo" helper
  tests: allow test_* in "test_must_fail_acceptable" for "test_todo"
  test-lib-functions: add and use a "todo_test_cmp" helper
  test-lib-functions: add and use a "todo_test_path" helper
  test-lib-functions: make test_todo support a --reset
  sparse tests: convert a TODO test to use "test_expect_todo"
