Subject: [PATCH 0/5] streaming.c: refactor for smaller + easier to understand code
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This is a prep series for my yet-to-be-sent re-roll of [1],
aka. ab/fsck-unexpected-type.

Jeff King had a comment in [2] saying it was odd to have an "oi2"
variable, that was because there was on an "oi" name already defined
via the new-gone open_method_decl(loose) macro. As we'll see we could
do without the initial "oi" and a few other types of indirection in
this interface.

Junio: Could you eject ab/fsck-unexpected-type while this is being
considered/cooked? I didn't really see how to address Jeff's feedback
about that variable name in a way that wouldn't just make something
like this refactoring part of an even bigger series. I think ejecting
the functional changes & trying to get this in first is the least
worst approach at this point. Eventually I'll submit a re-roll of
ab/fsck-unexpected-type either based on this, or master (if it's
landed already).

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (5):
  streaming.c: avoid forward declarations
  streaming.c: remove enum/function/vtbl indirection
  streaming.c: remove {open,close,read}_method_decl() macros
  streaming.c: stop passing around "object_info *" to open()
  streaming.c: move {open,close,read} from vtable to "struct
    git_istream"
