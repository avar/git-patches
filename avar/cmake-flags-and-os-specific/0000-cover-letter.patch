Subject: [PATCH 0/6] cmake: guard OS-specific code & cleanup & chmod +x on *nix
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

As with [1] and [2] submitted today these are extracted from the
ejected [2]. This is independent from [1] and [2]. These are all the
cmake changes I'll be submitting for now.

This series:

 - Cleans up some dead code in the recipe (1/6)
 - Adds a missing USE_LIBPCRE2 to GIT-BUILD-OPTIONS. We didn't see
   failures due to this because the win+VS job doesn't build with
   libpcre2 (2/6)
 - Wraps Windows-specific code in "if" checks for that platform
   (3-4/6). We already support cmake on *nix, this makes it clearer
   which bits are OS-specific
 - We had failing p4 tests due to omitting copying over
   git-p4.py. This is anotehr case where we didn't see a failure
   because the "win+VS" job doesn't test that part.
 - Do a "chmod +x" of the bin-wrappers, Windows didn't care, but on
   *nix running the tests would fail *a lot* due to this.

All in all on my *nix box this brings us from:

	80% tests passed, 194 tests failed out of 983

To:

	99% tests passed, 3 tests failed out of 983

The remaining failures are due to "gitweb" being broken, but that's a
general known shortcoming of the "cmake" recipe (which again, isn't
spotted by "win+VS" in CI because it skips those tests).

The remaining bits in [3] will get us to 100% passing. I still think
those are worthwhile, but there were some outstanding concerns about
them (e.g. changing how "GIT-BUILD-DIR" worked, and adding a *nix CI
job for cmake).

I don't think there's any outstanding comments or known or potential
concerns/breakages with these changes that have to be addressed, these
are all straightforward fixes.

CI & branch for this at [4] (where I have it on top of [1] and [2])
