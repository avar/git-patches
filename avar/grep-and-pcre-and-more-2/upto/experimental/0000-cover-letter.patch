Subject: [PATCH v2 0/7] PCRE v2, PCRE v1 JIT, log -P & fixes
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Trivial changes since v1, but I wanted to send a new one for
completeness since I re-sent the "Easy to review grep & pre-PCRE
changes" series.

For v1 see <20170511170142.15934-1-avarab@gmail.com>
(https://public-inbox.org/git/20170511170142.15934-1-avarab@gmail.com/).

Changes noted below & reply to who noted the issue:

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (7):
  grep: don't redundantly compile throwaway patterns under threading

Brandon: Added a few paragraphs to the commit message about why this
change is being made, i.e. for ease of understanding the code, not
optimization.

  grep: skip pthreads overhead when using one thread
  log: add -P as a synonym for --perl-regexp
  grep: add support for the PCRE v1 JIT API
  grep: un-break building with PCRE < 8.32
  grep: un-break building with PCRE < 8.20
  grep: add support for PCRE v2

No changes in these, except for re-running the performance tests &
changing the commit messages accordingly, due to the change in the
t/perf code in the previous series, as noted there.
