Subject: [PATCH v2 00/29] Easy to review grep & pre-PCRE changes
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Easy to review? 29 patches? Are you kidding me?!

As noted in v1 (<20170511091829.5634-1-avarab@gmail.com>;
https://public-inbox.org/git/20170511091829.5634-1-avarab@gmail.com/)
these are all doc, test, refactoring etc. changes needed by the
subsequent "PCRE v2, PCRE v1 JIT, log -P & fixes" series.

Thanks a lot for the review everyone. This fixes all the issues
raised. Changes noted below, with names prefixed by the person who
raised the issue.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (29):
  Makefile & configure: reword inaccurate comment about PCRE
  grep & rev-list doc: stop promising libpcre for --perl-regexp
  test-lib: rename the LIBPCRE prerequisite to PCRE

No changes.

  log: add exhaustive tests for pattern style options & config

Johannes: Now doesn't create a "(1|2)" tag, so should work on Windows
& beyond (wasn't needed, just created as a side-effect of test_commit)

Junio: Added comments for tricky basic/extended/perl

Junio: Moved all the 'test_have_prereq PCRE' test / test_cmp code
together, not apart as before.

  grep: add a test asserting that --perl-regexp dies when !PCRE
  grep: add a test for backreferences in PCRE patterns

No changes.

  grep: change non-ASCII -i test to stop using --debug

Brandon: Removed stray leftover unused --debug

  grep: add tests for --threads=N and grep.threads

Brandon: Amended commit message to clarify that this test doesn't need
a NO_PTHREADS prerequisite, and we actually get coverage out of
testing with --threads=N when not with threads, or at least it doesn't
harm anything.

  grep: amend submodule recursion test for regex engine testing

Junio: Now "foo" -> "(1|2)" as the commit message claims, not ->
"(1|2)d".

  grep: add tests for grep pattern types being passed to submodules

No changes.

  grep: add a test helper function for less verbose -f \0 tests

Junio: "nul_match() {" -> "nul_match () {" & quote "$status" & don't
quote non-variable strings.

  grep: prepare for testing binary regexes containing rx metacharacters

No changes.

  grep: add tests to fix blind spots with \0 patterns

Junio: Also fixed quoted variable strings here as above.

  perf: add a GIT_PERF_MAKE_COMMAND for when *_MAKE_OPTS won't do
  perf: emit progress output when unpacking & building

No changes.

  perf: add a performance comparison test of grep -G, -E and -P

All my multibyte performance tests were done with the string
'm(ú|u)ult.b(æ|y)te' which didn't match anything in the kernel, now
done with 'm(ú|u)lt.b(æ|y)te' instead.

I re-ran all the performance tests mentioned in the commit messages
where applicable.

  perf: add a performance comparison of fixed-string grep

One test_cmp was run twice due to rebasing from the pcre1/pcre2 days
of this series. Fixed.

  grep: catch a missing enum in switch statement

Stefan: Removed the comment about die(..BUG) & put the relevant detail
in the commit message instead.

  grep: remove redundant regflags assignment under PCRE
  grep: remove redundant `regflags &= ~REG_EXTENDED` assignments

No changes.

  grep: factor test for \0 in grep patterns into a function

Brandon: Fix comment syntax creating the function, and move it to the
correct place now instead of later in the "move is_fixed()" commit.

  grep: change the internal PCRE macro names to be PCRE1
  grep: change internal *pcre* variable & function names to be *pcre1*

No changes.

  grep: move is_fixed() earlier to avoid forward declaration

Brandon: Now just moves is_fixed() instead of is_fixed() & has_null()

  test-lib: add a PTHREADS prerequisite
  pack-objects & index-pack: add test for --threads warning
  pack-objects: fix buggy warning about threads

No changes.

  grep: given --threads with NO_PTHREADS=YesPlease, warn

Use Git standard comment syntax for TRANSLATORS comment.

  grep: assert that threading is enabled when calling grep_{lock,unlock}
