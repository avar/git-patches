         In a subsequent commit I'll be replacing most of this code to log N
         parents, but let's first fix bugs introduced in the recent
    @@ Commit message
         system where we could read the file from procfs.
     
         Let's move all the freeing of the memory to the end of the
    -    function. If we're still at STRBUF_INIT with "name" due to not haven

         taken the branch where the strbuf_read_file() succeeds freeing it is

         handling freeing the same way for all branches of the function makes
         it more readable.
