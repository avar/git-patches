Subject: [PATCH 01/24] t/helper/test-fast-rebase.c: don't leak "struct strbuf"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Fix a memory leak that's been with us since f9500261e0a (fast-rebase:
write conflict state to working tree, index, and HEAD, 2021-05-20)
changed this code to move these strbuf_release() into an if/else
block.

We'll also add to "reflog_msg" in the "else" arm of the "if" block
being modified here, and we'll append to "branch_msg" in both
cases. But after f9500261e0a only the "if" block would free these two
"struct strbuf".

This change is needed so that a subsequent addition of a "goto
cleanup" pattern when adding release_revisions() doesn't solve this
unrelated bug while it's at it.
