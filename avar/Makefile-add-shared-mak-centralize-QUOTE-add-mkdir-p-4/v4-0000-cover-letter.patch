    -    This does have the potential downside that if e.g. templates/Makefile
    -    would like to include this "shared.mak" in the future the semantics of
    -    such a Makefile will change, but as noted in the above commits (and
    -    GNU make's own documentation) any such change would be for the better,
    -    so it's safe to do this.
    +    I.e. this changes the behavior of existing rules in the altered
    +    Makefiles (except "Makefile" & "Documentation/Makefile"). I'm
    +    confident that this is safe having read the relevant rules in those
    +    Makfiles, and as the GNU make manual notes that it isn't the default
    +    behavior is out of an abundance of backwards compatibility
    +    caution. From edition 0.75 of its manual, covering GNU make 4.3:
     
    -    This also doesn't introduce a bug by e.g. having this
    +        [Enabling '.DELETE_ON_ERROR' is] almost always what you want
    +        'make' to do, but it is not historical practice; so for
    +        compatibility, you must explicitly request it.
    +
    +    This doesn't introduce a bug by e.g. having this
         ".DELETE_ON_ERROR" flag only apply to this new shared.mak, Makefiles
         have no such scoping semantics.
     
    +    It does increase the danger that any Makefile without an explicit "The
    +    default target of this Makefile is..." snippet to define the default
    +    target as "all" could have its default rule changed if our new
    +    shared.mak ever defines a "real" rule. In subsequent commits we'll be
    +    careful not to do that, and such breakage would be obvious e.g. in the
    +    case of "make -C t".
    +
    +    We might want to make that less fragile still (e.g. by using
    +    ".DEFAULT_GOAL" as noted in the preceding commit), but for now let's
    +    simply include "shared.mak" without adding that boilerplate to all the
    +    Makefiles that don't have it already. Most of those are already
    +    exposed to that potential caveat e.g. due to including "config.mak*".
