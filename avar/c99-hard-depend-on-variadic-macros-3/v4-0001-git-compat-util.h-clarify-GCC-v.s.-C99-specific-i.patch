Subject: [PATCH v4 1/2] git-compat-util.h: clarify GCC v.s. C99-specific in
 comment
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Change a comment added in e208f9cc757 (make error()'s constant return
value more visible, 2012-12-15). It's not correct that this is GCC-ism
anymore, it's code that uses standard C99 features.

The comment being changed here pre-dates the HAVE_VARIADIC_MACROS
define, which we got in e05bed960d3 (trace: add 'file:line' to all
trace output, 2014-07-12).

The original implementation of an error() macro) in e208f9cc757 used a
GCC-ism with the paste operator (see the commit message for mention of
it), but that was dropped later by 9798f7e5f9 (Use __VA_ARGS__ for all
of error's arguments, 2013-02-08), giving us the C99-portable version
we have now.

While we could remove the __GNUC__ define here, it might cause issues
for other compilers or static analysis systems, so let's not. See
87fe5df365 (inline constant return from error() function, 2014-05-06)
for one such issue.

See also e05bed960d3 (trace: add 'file:line' to all trace output,
2014-07-12) for another comment about GNUC's handling of __VA_ARGS__.
