Subject: [PATCH v4 0/3] add a test mode for SANITIZE=leak, run it in CI
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

We can compile git with SANITIZE=leak, and have had various efforts in
the past such as 31f9acf9ce2 (Merge branch 'ah/plugleaks', 2021-08-04)
to plug memory leaks, but have had no CI testing of it to ensure that
we don't get regressions. This series adds a GIT_TEST_* mode for
checking those regressions, and runs it in CI.

Since I submitted v2 the delta between origin/master..origin/seen
broke even t0001-init.sh when run under SANITIZE=leak, so this series
will cause test smoke on "seen".

That failure is due to a bug in es/config-based-hooks [1] and the
hn/reftable topic, i.e. these patches are legitimately catching
regressions in "seen" from day 1.

Changes since v3:

 * Much updated commit message

 * Re-arranged the t/README change to avoid a conflict with "seen".

 * Now testing OSX as well as Linux. Full CI passes on top of "master"
   on both: https://github.com/avar/git/runs/3535331215

 * I ejected the previous 4-8/8 patches of adding SANITIZE=leak
   annotations to various tests, let's focus on the test mode itself
   here and not overly distracting ourselves with whatever other
   regressions on "seen" those annotations might cause, I can submit
   those annotations later.

 * As noted in the updated commit message I didn't end up going with
   Jeff King's suggestion of supporting LSAN_OPTIONS directly, and
   fixing the "fd" the tests write to. All of those things can be
   extended or fixed later.

         tests: add a test mode for SANITIZE=leak, run it in CI
     
    -    While git can be compiled with SANITIZE=leak there has been no
    -    corresponding GIT_TEST_* mode for it, i.e. memory leaks have been
    -    fixed as one-offs without structured regression testing.
    +    While git can be compiled with SANITIZE=leak we have not run
    +    regression tests under that mode, memory leaks have only been fixed as
    +    one-offs without structured regression testing.
     
    -    This change add such a mode, and a new linux-SANITIZE=leak CI
    -    target. The test mode and CI target only runs a whitelist of
    -    known-good tests using a mechanism discussed below, to ensure that we
    -    won't add regressions to code that's had its memory leaks fixed.
    +    This change add CI testing for it. We'll now build with GCC under
    +    Linux and test t000[04]*.sh with SANITIZE=leak, and likewise with GCC
    +    on OSX. The new jobs are called "linux-SANITIZE=leak" and
    +    "osx-SANITIZE=leak".
     
         The CI target uses a new GIT_TEST_PASSING_SANITIZE_LEAK=true test
    -    mode. When running in that mode all tests except those that have opted
    -    themselves in to running by setting and exporting
    -    TEST_PASSES_SANITIZE_LEAK=true before sourcing test-lib.sh.
    +    mode. When running in that mode, we'll assert that we were compiled
    +    with SANITIZE=leak, and then skip all tests except those that we've
    +    opted-in by setting "TEST_PASSES_SANITIZE_LEAK=true" before sourcing
    +    test-lib.sh (see discussion in t/README).
     
    -    I'm adding a "test-pragma-SANITIZE=leak-ok.sh" wrapper for setting and
    -    exporting that variable, as the assignment/export boilerplate would
    -    otherwise get quite verbose and repetitive in subsequent commits.
    +    The tests using the "TEST_PASSES_SANITIZE_LEAK=true" setting can in
    +    turn make use of the "SANITIZE_LEAK" prerequisite, should they wish to
    +    selectively skip tests even under
    +    "GIT_TEST_PASSING_SANITIZE_LEAK=true". In a preceding commit we
    +    started doing this in "t0004-unwritable.sh" under SANITIZE=leak, now
    +    it'll combine nicely with "GIT_TEST_PASSING_SANITIZE_LEAK=true".
     
    -    The tests using the "test-pragma-SANITIZE=leak-ok.sh" pragma can in
    -    turn make use of the "SANITIZE_LEAK" prerequisite added in a preceding
    -    commit, should they wish to selectively skip tests even under
    -    "GIT_TEST_PASSING_SANITIZE_LEAK=true".
    -
    -    Now tests that don't set the "test-pragma-SANITIZE=leak-ok.sh" pragma
    -    will be skipped under GIT_TEST_PASSING_SANITIZE_LEAK=true:
    +    Now tests that don't set "TEST_PASSES_SANITIZE_LEAK=true" will be
    +    skipped under GIT_TEST_PASSING_SANITIZE_LEAK=true:
     
             $ GIT_TEST_PASSING_SANITIZE_LEAK=true ./t0001-init.sh
             1..0 # SKIP skip all tests in t0001 under SANITIZE=leak, TEST_PASSES_SANITIZE_LEAK not set
     
    -    In subsequents commit we'll conservatively add more
    -    TEST_PASSES_SANITIZE_LEAK=true annotations. The idea is that as memory
    -    leaks are fixed we can add more known-good tests to this CI target, to
    -    ensure that we won't have regressions.
    +    The intent is to add more TEST_PASSES_SANITIZE_LEAK=true annotations
    +    as follow-up change, but let's start small to begin with.
    +
    +    It would also be possible to implement a more lightweight version of
    +    this by only relying on setting "LSAN_OPTIONS". See
    +    <YS9OT/pn5rRK9cGB@coredump.intra.peff.net>[1] and
    +    <YS9ZIDpANfsh7N+S@coredump.intra.peff.net>[2] for a discussion of
    +    that. I've opted for this approach of adding a GIT_TEST_* mode instead
    +    because it's consistent with how we handle other special test modes.
    +
    +    Being able to add a "!SANITIZE_LEAK" prerequisite and calling
    +    "test_done" early if it isn't satisfied also means that we can more
    +    incrementally add regression tests without being forced to fix
    +    widespread and hard-to-fix leaks at the same time.
    +
    +    We have tests that do simple checking of some tool we're interested
    +    in, but later on in the script might be stressing trace2, or common
    +    sources of leaks like "git log" in combination with the tool (e.g. the
    +    commit-graph tests). To be clear having a prerequisite could also be
    +    accomplished by using "LSAN_OPTIONS" directly.
    +
    +    On the topi of "LSAN_OPTIONS": It would be nice to have a mode to
    +    aggregate all failures in our various scripts, see [2] for a start at
    +    doing that which sets "log_path" in "LSAN_OPTIONS". I've punted on
    +    that for now, it can be added later, and that proposed patch is also
    +    hindered by us wanting to test e.g. test-tool leaks (and by proxy, any
    +    API leaks they uncover), not just the "common-main.c" entry point.
     
         As of writing this we've got major regressions between master..seen,
         i.e. the t000*.sh tests and more fixed since 31f9acf9ce2 (Merge branch

    +    The reason for using gcc on OSX over the clang default is because
