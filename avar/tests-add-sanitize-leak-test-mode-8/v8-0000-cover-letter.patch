Subject: [PATCH v8 0/2] add a test mode for SANITIZE=leak, run it in CI
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This series adds a small beachhead of tests we run in CI that we
assert to be memory-leak free with the SANITIZE=leak test mode. Once
it lands the intent is to expand the parts of the test suite we
whitelist as memory-leak free.

For the v7 see:
https://lore.kernel.org/git/cover-v7-0.2-00000000000-20210919T075619Z-avarab@gmail.com/

This v8 fixes a test failure that happened in combination with the
sg/test-split-index-fix topic, which just unearthed an old
GIT_TEST_SPLIT_INDEX=true memory leak.

Carlo Marcelo Arenas Belón had a fixup for it (that's currently
applied to the v7) here:
https://lore.kernel.org/git/20210922111741.82142-1-carenas@gmail.com/

I acked it in
https://lore.kernel.org/git/87h7ec59m7.fsf@evledraar.gmail.com/; but
on second thought I think this is a better solution for the reasons
noted in the updated commit message.

    @@ Commit message
         The intent is to add more TEST_PASSES_SANITIZE_LEAK=true annotations
         as follow-up change, but let's start small to begin with.
     
    +    In ci/run-build-and-tests.sh we make use of the default "*" case to
    +    run "make test" without any GIT_TEST_* modes. SANITIZE=leak is known
    +    to fail in combination with GIT_TEST_SPLIT_INDEX=true in
    +    t0016-oidmap.sh, and we're likely to have other such failures in
    +    various GIT_TEST_* modes. Let's focus on getting the base tests
    +    passing, we can expand coverage to GIT_TEST_* modes later.
    +
         It would also be possible to implement a more lightweight version of
         this by only relying on setting "LSAN_OPTIONS". See
