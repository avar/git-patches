Subject: [PATCH v3 0/2] show-brach: segfault fix from Gregory David
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This is a version of
https://lore.kernel.org/git/225b410d-2d98-8c0b-c289-22f753c175d4@p1sec.com/
that applies with "git am", the patch got munged in transit (from the
looks of it from Thunderbird's wrapping).

I added a 1/2 to factor out some shared code used by the segfault fix,
and made the now-smaller 2/2 use that function.

I also renamed some varibles to reduce wrapping, and made the
append_one_rev() come after the ref formatting. Other similar code
above does that, it looks to me like they're equivalent
(append_one_rev increments ref_name_cnt).

Gregory David (1):
  show-branch: fix SEGFAULT when `--current` and `--reflog` together

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (1):
  show-branch: refactor in preparation for next commit
