Subject: [PATCH v3 1/6] Makefile: guard against TEST_OBJS in the environment
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Add TEST_OBJS to the list of other *_OBJS variables we reset. We had
already established this pattern when TEST_OBJS was introduced in
daa99a91729 (Makefile: make sure test helpers are rebuilt when headers
change, 2010-01-26), but it wasn't added to the list in that commit
along with the rest.
