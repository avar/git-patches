Subject: [PATCH 00/13] hook.[ch]: new library to run hooks + simple hook conversion
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This series is part 2 of an incremental restart of the greater
"config-based hooks" topic by Emily Shaffer that I've been helping
with. See [1] for part 1, and [2] (search for "mark2") for a summary
of parts to come.

This goes on top of the "ab/config-based-hooks-1" topic that's already
in "next" and marked for graduation to "master".

In this topic we build upon the skeleton hook.[ch] library and build
infrastructure added in part 1 and add a hook running library and new
"git hook" command.

The new "git hook" command is (for now) only for the benefit of
in-tree non-C programs that need to run hooks, and this series
converts git-send-email and git-p4 to use it.

At the end of the series we remove
"run_hook_{le,ve}()" from run-command.c, as we've migrated all its
callers.

What we don't do is convert any of the more complex in-tree hooks that
require input on stdin such as "pre-receive" and the like, that's in
later parts once this lands.

This series is approximately patch 6-20/36 of the previous 36 patch
ab/config-based-hooks-base topic. A range-diff to that v5[3] is
included below.

The changes since that v5 are trivial, mostly formatting changes to
reduce the diff to parts that come after this (which Emily & I were
juggling at the time), and re-flowing some overly long lines.

This should all be pretty solid and well tested, but the git-p4.py
part in particular I've never tested for real (not having access to
p4), and think Emily hasn't either[4]. The relevant patch looks
trivially correct to me, and I've tried it out in the Python REPL. But
if any of the CC'd people active in git-p4.py development could give
it some end-to-end testing that would be much appreciated.
