Subject: [PATCH v2 16/16] tag: add tests for --with and --without
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Change the test suite to test for these synonyms for --contains and
--no-contains, respectively.

Before this change there were no tests for them at all. This doesn't
exhaustively test for them as well as their --contains and
--no-contains synonyms, but at least it's something.
