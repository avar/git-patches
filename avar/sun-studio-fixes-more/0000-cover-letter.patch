Subject: [PATCH 0/4] Eliminate warnings under Sun Studio
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This patch series eliminates warnings under Sun Studio. The first two
patches address actual (but obviously minor) issues, the third is a
nit, and the fourth disables a warning Sun Studio gets wrong.

I'm not sure whether we want the verbose code needed in the forth to
disable warnings under specific compilers, but since it's a rare
enough case and saves people compiling the code from wondering about
it's it's probably warranted. It's a verbose way to get rid of it
though.

I've CC'd people involved in the code touched by the first two, but
the second two are generic enough that I've decided not to bother the
original authors.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (4):
  Fix an enum assignment issue spotted by Sun Studio
  Fix a bitwise negation assignment issue spotted by Sun Studio
  Appease Sun Studio by renaming "tmpfile"
  Suppress "statement not reached" warnings under Sun Studio
