Subject: [RFC PATCH 0/5] fix issues in transfer.credentialsInUrl
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This is on top of [1], and given the "rc" phase is an RFC. This:

 * Fixes the issue of the transfer.credentialsInUrl (now renamed) not
   finding passwords in "pushurl" URLs (in my case, the only place
   where I'd actually put a password in a URL in a config...)

 * 1/5 fixes a bug in an existing test, but I didn't think it was
   worth bothering with for 2.37.0.

 * Adds missing test coverage for reading the config from a file, not
   the CLI.

 * 3/5 is a WIP CI target to spot the type of issue I fixed in [2],
   it's not the first time where we have a NO_CURL=Y breakage land on
   master...

 * 4/5 attemps to "really" fix the duplicate warnings we emit, I think
   the approach there is good, especially the part where we shouldn't
   emit it twice in-process.

   But this currently misses e.g. "git ls-remote". I wonder if we
   should just stick that git_config_push_parameter() condition into
   packet_trace_identity() and call it a day.

 * 5/5 fixes the (major) blind spot of the warning missing "pushurl" config.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (5):
  push tests: add a missing "test_line_count"
  fetch+push tests: add missing coverage for 6dcbdc0d661
  CI: add a linux-BUILD-vars job
  fetch: stop emitting duplicate transfer.credentialsInUrl=warn warnings
  transport: check remote.<name>pushurl with transfer.credentialsInUrl
