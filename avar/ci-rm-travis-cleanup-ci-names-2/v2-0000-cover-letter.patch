    @@ Commit message
         commit view. I.e. when mouse-clicking on the passing or failing
         check-mark next to the commit subject.
     
    -    That description is truncated to 24 characters, with the 3 at the end
    -    being placed by "...".
    -
    -    E.g. the full job name (visible at [1]):
    -
    -        "regular (linux-gcc-default, gcc, ubuntu-latest)"
    -
    -    Will, when shown in the tool-tip be truncated to:
    -
    -        "CI/PR / regular (linu..."
    -
    -    There's then a further limit in the expanded view where the job names
    -    are observably truncated to 44 characters (including "..."). I.e.:
    -
    -        "regular (linux-gcc-default, gcc, ubuntu-l..."
    -
    -    With this change we shorten both the job names, and change the
    -    top-level "name" from "CI/PR" to "CI", since it will be used as a
    -    prefix in the tooltips. We also remove redundant or superfluous
    -    information from the name, e.g. "ubuntu-latest" isn't really needed
    -    for "linux-leaks", it'll suffice to say linux. For discovering what
    -    image runs that specifically we can consult main.yml itself.
    -
    -    The above "regular (linux-gcc-default, gcc, ubuntu-latest)" job name
    -    then becomes a 1=1 match to the "$jobname" used in
    -    "ci/run-build-and-tests.sh". A "( push" or " (pull_request" is then
    -    added implicitly as before (from the top-level "on" parameter in
    -    "main.yml"). In the tooltip we'll now show:
    -
    -        "CI / linux-leaks (pu..."
    -
    -    We then have no truncation in the expanded view. See [2] for a
    -    currently visible CI run using this commit, and [3] for the GitHub
    -    workflow syntax involved being changed here.
    -
    -    We could avoid even more truncation with more compact names,
    -    e.g. changing "linux" to "lin" or "lnx", but I didn't do that since
    -    any additional shortening seemed counterproductive, i.e. "w32" is a
    -    well-known way of referring to "Windows", but "lin" isn't). We could
    -    also shorten e.g. "::build" and "::test" to "+bld" and "+tst", but
    -    those seem similarly to be overly obtuse.
    +    These names are seemingly truncated to 17-20 characters followed by
    +    three dots ("..."). Since a "CI/PR / " prefix is added to them the job
    +    names looked like this before (windows-test and vs-test jobs omitted):
    +
    +        CI/PR / ci-config (p...
    +        CI/PR / windows-buil...

    +
    +    By omitting the "/PR" from the top-level name, and pushing the
    +    $jobname to the front we'll now instead get:
    +
    +        CI / config (push)
    +        CI / win build (push...

    +        CI / documentation
    +
    +    We then have no truncation in the expanded view. See [1] for how it
    +    looked before, [2] for a currently visible CI run using this commit,
    +    and [3] for the GitHub workflow syntax involved being changed here.
    +
    +    Let's also add a field for the "os" and use it where appropriate, it's
    +    occasionally useful to know we're running on say ubuntu
    +    v.s. fedora (but the "-latest" suffix isn't very useful, that applies
    +    to almost all the jobs.
