    -    test-lib.sh: have all tests pass under "-x", remove BASH_XTRACEFD
    +    test-lib.sh: remove the now-unused "test_untraceable" facility
     
    -    Change the "t1510-repo-setup.sh" test to use a new
    -    "test_must_be_empty_trace" wrapper, instead of turning on
    -    "test_untraceable=UnfortunatelyYes".
    +    In the preceding commit the use of "test_untraceable=UnfortunatelyYes"
    +    was removed from "t1510-repo-setup.sh" in favor of more narrow
    +    redirections of the output of specific commands (and not entire
    +    sub-shells or functions).
     
    -    The only reason the test was incompatible with "-x" was because of
    -    these "test_must_be_empty" checks, which we can instead instead skip
    -    if we're running under "set -x".
    +    This is in line with the fixes in the series that introduced the
    +    "test_untraceable" facility. See 571e472dc43 (Merge branch
    +    'sg/test-x', 2018-03-14) for the series as a whole, and
    +    e.g. 91538d0cde9 (t5570-git-daemon: don't check the stderr of a
    +    subshell, 2018-02-24) for a commit that's in line with the changes in
    +    the preceding commit.
     
    -    Skipping the tests is preferable to not having the "-x" output at all,
    -    as it's much easier to debug the test. The result loss of test
    -    coverage is minimal. If someone is adjusting a "test_must_be_empty"
    -    test a failure might go away under "-x", but the new "say" we emit
    -    here should highlight that appropriately.
    +    We've thus solved the TODO item noted when "test_untraceable" was
    +    added to "t1510-repo-setup.sh" in 58275069288 (t1510-repo-setup: mark
    +    as untraceable with '-x', 2018-02-24).
     
    -    Since the only user of "test_untraceable" is gone, we can remove that,
    -    not only isn't it used now, but I think the rationale for using it in
    -    the future no longer applies.
    +    So let's remove the feature entirely. Not only is it currently unused,
    +    but it actively encourages an anti-pattern in our tests. We should be
    +    testing the output of specific commands, not entire subshells or
    +    functions.
     
    -    We'll be better off by using a simple wrapper like the new
    -    "test_must_be_empty_trace". See 58275069288 (t1510-repo-setup: mark as
    -    untraceable with '-x', 2018-02-24) and 5fc98e79fc0 (t: add means to
    -    disable '-x' tracing for individual test scripts, 2018-02-24) for the
    -    addition of "test_untraceable".
    -
    -    Once that's been removed we can dig deeper and see that we only have
    -    "BASH_XTRACEFD" due to an earlier attempt to work around the same
    -    issue. See d88785e424a (test-lib: set BASH_XTRACEFD automatically,
    -    2016-05-11) and the 90c8a1db9d6 (test-lib: silence "-x" cleanup under
    -    bash, 2017-12-08) follow-up.
    -
    -    I.e. we had redirection in "test_eval_" to get more relevant trace
    -    output under bash, which in turn was only needed because
    -    BASH_XTRACEFD=1 was set, which in turn was trying to work around test
    -    failures under "set -x".
    -
    -    It's better if our test suite works the same way on all shells, rather
    -    than getting a passing run under "bash", only to have it fail with
    -    "-x" under say "dash". As the deleted code shows this is much simpler
    -    to implement across our supported POSIX shells.
    +    That the "-x" output had to be disabled as a result is only one
    +    symptom, but even under bash those tests will be harder to debug as
    +    the subsequent check of the redirected file will be far removed from
    +    the command that emitted the output.
