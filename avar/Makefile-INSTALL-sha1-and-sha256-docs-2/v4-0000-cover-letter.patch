Subject: [PATCH v4 0/9] Makefile & docs: document SHA-{1,256} behavior, fix bug
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This is a documentation update to get to the eventual goal of making
DC_SHA1 the defaul on OSX. First we need to stop claiming that OpenSSL
is still our default everywhere, etc.

For v3 see:
https://lore.kernel.org/git/cover-v3-0.9-00000000000-20221020T223946Z-avarab@gmail.com/;
The updates here are all typos/grammar etc. issues spotted by Eric
Sunshine, thanks!

Junio: This v4 introduces a minor conflict with the subsequent DC_SHA1
topic[1], but you haven't picked that one up either, so I'm assuming
if you're interested in this at all it's better to cook this first.

In case you want both It's easily solved (just keep the other topic's
post-image). I.e. Eric pointed out a better wording for a paragraph,
but it's the one we're mostly removing/rewriting in [1].
