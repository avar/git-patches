Subject: [PATCH v4 9/9] Makefile: discuss SHAttered in *_SHA{1,256} discussion
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Let's mention the SHAttered attack and more generally why we use the
sha1collisiondetection backend by default, and note that for SHA-256
the user should feel free to pick any of the supported backends as far
as hashing security is concerned.
