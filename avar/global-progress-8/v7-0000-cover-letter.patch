Subject: [PATCH v7 0/7] progress: test fixes / cleanup
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

A series that used to be about adding a "global progress" state, but
started with some cleanups & adding the ability to test that mode. See
[1] for the v6 and [2] for a discussion on the previous 8/8 patch.

This v7 ejects that 8/8 patch. I think it's safe to merge down, but
per [3] etc. this topic has been stalled for a while in "needs
review". I think it's had enough thorough review. The sticking point
has been me & SZEDER disagreeing on whether adding that BUG() in the
previous 8/8 can be deemed safe or not.

So let's bypass that for now and hopefully queue these up. Once this
lands we can re-visit that 8/8 and various other progress.c API & UX
improvements I have unsubmitted, which have been blocked by this
topic.

  leak tests: fix a memory leaks in "test-progress" helper
  progress.c test helper: add missing braces
  progress.c tests: make start/stop commands on stdin
  progress.c tests: test some invalid usage
  progress.c: add temporary variable from progress struct
  pack-bitmap-write.c: don't return without stop_progress()
  various *.c: use isatty(0|2), not isatty(STDIN_FILENO|STDERR_FILENO)
