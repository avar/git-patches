         Stylistically fix up code added in bfac23d9534 (grep: Fix two memory
         leaks, 2010-01-30). We usually don't use the "arg" at all once we've

    +    casted it to the struct we want, let's not do that here when we're
         freeing it. Perhaps it was thought that a cast to "void *" would
         otherwise be needed?
