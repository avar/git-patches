Subject: [PATCH 0/5] serve: add "configure" callback
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This is a refactoring of what a callback in serve.c needs to do to
aquire config. Currently two of them want that, and grab it in ad-hoc
ways themselves, now they can insted configure a "configure" callback
along with the existing "advertise" and "command", by the time they're
called their config will already be read with their callback.

I split this prep work off from an upcoming series where I wanted to
add a new capability, but I think this stands nicely on its own, and
simplifies the existing code.

The line count increase is mostly converting things to designated
initializers.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (5):
  serve: mark has_capability() as static
  transport: rename "fetch" in transport_vtable to "fetch_refs"
  transport: use designated initializers
  serve: use designated initializers
  serve: add support for a git_config() callback
