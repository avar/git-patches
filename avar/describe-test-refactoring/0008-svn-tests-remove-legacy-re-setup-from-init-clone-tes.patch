Subject: [PATCH 08/10] svn tests: remove legacy re-setup from init-clone test
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Remove the immediate "rm -rf .git" from the start of this test. This
was added back in 41337e22f0 (git-svn: add tests for command-line
usage of init and clone commands, 2007-11-17) when there was a "trash"
directory shared by all the tests, but ever since abc5d372ec (Enable
parallel tests, 2008-08-08) we've had per-test trash directories.

So this setup can simply be removed. We could use
TEST_NO_CREATE_REPO=true, but I don't think it's worth the effort to
go out of our way to be different. It doesn't matter that we now have
a redundant .git at the top-level.
