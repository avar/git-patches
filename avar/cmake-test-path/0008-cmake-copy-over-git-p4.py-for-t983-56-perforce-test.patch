Subject: [PATCH 8/9] cmake: copy over git-p4.py for t983[56] perforce test
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Since [1] two git-p4 tests have relied on there being a "git-p4.py" in
the build directory, but the cmake recipe was not updated to account
for this. Let's copy the "git-p4.py" over.

We could also change the test to e.g. grab the built "git-p4" and
alter its shebang, which would be friendly to GIT_TEST_INSTALLED, but
let's just do the bare minimum here to get cmake+ctest working without
altering the test itself.

The reason this hasn't been caught by "vs-build" and "vs-test" is
because those tests added in [2] invoke "cmake" with
"-DPYTHON_TESTS=OFF", and therefore we'd skip this part of the git-p4
tests before getting past the "do we have python?" check. Even if we
got past that the Windows CI wouldn't have a "p4" or "p4d" binary
installed, so we'd skip the tests anyway.

In a subsequent commit we'll run "cmake" and "ctest" in CI with
"ubuntu-latest", so we'll need this "git-p4.py" file.
