Subject: [PATCH 0/2] prompt.c: split up git_prompt(), read from /dev/tty, not STDIN
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

I had a stupid bug in another series of mine[1] breaking code around
git_prompt() in bisect--helper.c, and in trying to follow-up to add
testing to that discovered that doing so was rather hard, due to how
git_prompt() behaves.

In another case in 2019 (which is the In-Reply-To here) we added a
seeming for-the-tests workaround for the same issue in "git am
--interacive".

This starts out by splitting the more complex "get a password
interactively" case out of prompt.c into a new prompt-password.c, most
of prompt.c's complexity was to cater to one API user in credential.c.

That being done move these callers to using git_prompt(), and have it
understanda a new GIT_TEST_TERMINAL_PROMPT=true variable so we can
have our cake and it it too in the test suite. If that's set the
prompt function will allow input on stdin.

This then allowed my to add the missing test for "git bisect" for the
code I'd accidentally broken in [1].

As noted in the discussion in 2/2 I'm not 100% sure this is the right
direction in terms of swiching us back to using /dev/tty and not
stdin, but see that commit & commit message for details. In any case,
whatever behavior we go for as far as the UX goes shouldn't be
catering only to the test suite.
