Subject: [RFC PATCH 0/4] ls-tree: pass state in struct, not globals
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

These are patches I've been carrying locally since April-ish, as a
follow-up to the "ls-tree --format" topic.

I'm submitting them here in reply to Teng's parallel RFC[1].

Teng: This conflicts with your topic, but re my suggestion of
submitting a separate clean-up series in [2] maybe you could look this
over, see how they differ from yours, and see what would make sense to
keep/incorporate for such a clean-up series?

E.g. 1/4 here is the opposite approach of your 3/6[3], but as 3/4
eventually shows we don't need that struct for anything except that
callback case.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (4):
  ls-tree: don't use "show_tree_data" for "fast" callbacks
  ls-tree: use a "struct options"
  ls-tree: fold "show_tree_data" into "cb" struct
  ls-tree: make "line_termination" less generic
