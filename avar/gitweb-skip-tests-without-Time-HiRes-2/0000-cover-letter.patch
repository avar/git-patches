Subject: [PATCH v2 0/2] Minor changes to skip gitweb tests without Time::HiRes
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This was originally just one small patch, but Jakub Narębski pointed
out that calling the module "unusable" when we failed to load it was
confusing, so now the start of this series is just a rephrasing of an
existing error message I copied.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (2):
  gitweb tests: Change confusing "skip_all" phrasing
  gitweb tests: Skip tests when we don't have Time::HiRes
