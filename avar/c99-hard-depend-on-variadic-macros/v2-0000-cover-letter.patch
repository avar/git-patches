Subject: [PATCH v2 0/2] C99: remove hardcoded-out !HAVE_VARIADIC_MACROS code
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This v2 of $subject is being submitted on the one-year anniversary of
the patch to hardcode away the !HAVE_VARIADIC_MACROS code.

This is another small step on the way towards changing the usage.[ch]
API so that we can log the actual file/line number of
usage()/warning()/error()/die() in trace2 events. See a greater RFC
series to do that at:
https://lore.kernel.org/git/RFC-cover-00.21-00000000000-20211115T220831Z-avarab@gmail.com/

This should address all feedback raised on v1, including Junio
thinking it was a no-go since the submission in April 2021 was was
relatively recently after we'd hardcoded away
!HAVE_VARIADIC_MACROS. We've now had several releases with that code,
and other recent C99 test balloons since then.

The since of the range-diff is mainly because in v1 I didn't notice
that I needed to move the relevant API docs around, which this v2
does.

         Change a comment added in e208f9cc757 (make error()'s constant return
    -    value more visible, 2012-12-15) to note that the code doesn't only
    -    depend on variadic macros, which have been a hard dependency since
    -    765dc168882 (git-compat-util: always enable variadic macros,
    -    2021-01-28), but also on GCC's handling of __VA_ARGS__. The commit
    -    message for e208f9cc757 made this clear, but the comment it added did
    -    not.
    +    value more visible, 2012-12-15). It's not correct that this is GCC-ism
    +    anymore, it's code that uses standard C99 features.
    +
    +    The comment being changed here pre-dates the HAVE_VARIADIC_MACROS
    +    define, which we got in e05bed960d3 (trace: add 'file:line' to all
    +    trace output, 2014-07-12).
    +
    +    The original implementation of an error() macro) in e208f9cc757 used a
    +    GCC-ism with the paste operator (see the commit message for mention of
    +    it), but that was dropped later by 9798f7e5f9 (Use __VA_ARGS__ for all
    +    of error's arguments, 2013-02-08), giving us the C99-portable version
    +    we have now.
    +
    +    While we could remove the __GNUC__ define here, it might cause issues
    +    for other compilers or static analysis systems, so let's not. See

    -    C99 support: remove non-HAVE_VARIADIC_MACROS code
    +    C99: remove hardcoded-out !HAVE_VARIADIC_MACROS code
     
    -    Remove code that depend on HAVE_VARIADIC_MACROS not being set. Since
    -    765dc168882 (git-compat-util: always enable variadic macros,
    -    2021-01-28) we've unconditionally defined it to be true, and that
    -    change went out with v2.31.0. This should have given packagers enough
    -    time to discover whether variadic macros were an issue.
    +    Remove the "else" branches of the HAVE_VARIADIC_MACROS macro, which
    +    has been unconditionally omitted since 765dc168882 (git-compat-util:
    +    always enable variadic macros, 2021-01-28).
     
    -    It seems that they weren't, so let's update the coding guidelines and
    -    remove all the fallback code for the non-HAVE_VARIADIC_MACROS case.
    +    Since they were hardcoded out anyone trying to compile a version of
    +    git v2.31.0 or later would have had a compilation error. 10 months
    +    across a few releases since then should have been enough time for
    +    anyone who cared to run into that and report the issue.
    +
    +    In addition to that, for anyone unsetting HAVE_VARIADIC_MACROS we've
    +    been emitting extremely verbose warnings since at least
    +    ee4512ed481 (trace2: create new combined trace facility,
    +    2019-02-22). That's because there is no such thing as a
    +    "region_enter_printf" or "region_leave_printf" format, so at least
    +    under GCC and Clang everything that includes trace.h (almost every
    +    file) emits a couple of warnings about that.
    +
    +    There's a large benefit to being able to have a hard dependency rely
    +    on variadic macros, the code surrounding usage.c is hard to maintain
    +    if we need to write two implementations of everything, and by relying
    +    on "__FILE__" and "__LINE__" along with "__VA_ARGS__" we can in the
    +    future make error(), die() etc. log where they were called from. We've
    +    also recently merged d67fc4bf0ba (Merge branch 'bc/require-c99',
    +    2021-12-10) which further cements our hard dependency on C99.
    +
    +    So let's delete the fallback code, and update our CodingGuidelines to
    +    note that we depend on this. The added bullet-point starts with
    +    lower-case for consistency with other bullet-points in that section.
    +
    +    The diff in "trace.h" is relatively hard to read, since we need to
    +    retain the existing API docs, which were comments on the code used if
    +    HAVE_VARIADIC_MACROS was not defined.
