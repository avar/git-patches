Subject: [PATCH v2 05/11] cat-file: fix a memory leak in --batch-command mode
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Fix a memory leak introduced in 440c705ea63 (cat-file: add
--batch-command mode, 2022-02-18). The free_cmds() function was only
called on "queued_nr" if we had a "flush" command. As the "without
flush for blob info" test added in the same commit shows we can't rely
on that, so let's call free_cmds() again at the end.

Since "nr" follows the usual pattern of being set to 0 if we've
free()'d the memory already it's OK to call it twice, even in cases
where we are doing a "flush".
