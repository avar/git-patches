MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Stop leaking the "head" variable, which we've been leaking since it
was originally added in [1], and in its current form since [2]

1. ed378ec7e85 (Make ref resolution saner, 2006-09-11)
2. d9e557a320b (show-branch: store resolved head in heap buffer,
   2017-02-14).
