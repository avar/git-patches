Subject: [PATCH v2 0/5] Makefile: don't die on AIX with open ./git
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8n
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

A v2, much the same, but moreso. But now with entirely different
reasons for existing.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (5):
  Makefile: rename objects in-place, don't clobber
  Makefile: rename scripts in-place, don't clobber
  Makefile: don't needlessly "rm $@ $@+" before "mv $@+ $@"
  Makefile: add the ".DELETE_ON_ERROR" flag
  Makefile: don't "rm configure" before generating it
