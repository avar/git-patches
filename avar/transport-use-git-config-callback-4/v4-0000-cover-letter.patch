Subject: [PATCH v4 00/10] serve.[ch]: general API cleanup + --advertise-refs cleanup
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This is a general API cleanup and simplifiction of of serve.[ch] and
its interaction with "upload-pack --advertise-refs".

Previous rounds of this series had a way to define "startup config"
for commands hanging off the v2 server. That's now entirely gone,
along with prep work required for it.

For v3, see :
https://lore.kernel.org/git/cover-00.12-00000000000-20210721T233307Z-avarab@gmail.com/

Despite the overall diffstat this is a net deletion of code in any
meaningful sense of reducing complexity, i.e. it goes into the plus on
the diffstat due to the addition of previously missing tests, and the
use of designated initializers.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (10):
  serve: mark has_capability() as static
  transport: rename "fetch" in transport_vtable to "fetch_refs"
  transport: use designated initializers
  serve: use designated initializers
  serve.[ch]: don't pass "struct strvec *keys" to commands
  serve: move transfer.advertiseSID check into session_id_advertise()
  serve.c: move version line to advertise_capabilities()
  {upload,receive}-pack tests: add --advertise-refs tests
  serve.[ch]: remove "serve_options", split up --advertise-refs code
  upload-pack: document and rename --advertise-refs

         The advertise_capabilities() is only called from serve() and we always
    -    emit this version line before it, it makes more sense to consider the
    -    capabilities part of a "header" that has the version, so let's move
    -    the writing of the version there.
    +    emit this version line before it. In a subsequent commit I'll make
    +    builtin/upload-pack.c sometimes call advertise_capabilities()
    +    directly, so it'll make sense to have this line emitted by
    +    advertise_capabilities(), not serve() itself.
