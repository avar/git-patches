Subject: [PATCH v2 0/2] add and apply a rule to find "unused" init+free
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This re-roll of [1] gets to the same end-state as far as the changed C
code is concerned, but I rewrote the coccinelle rule to be much more
general, based on the more recent discussion at [2].

See the "contrib/coccinelle/unused.cocci" part of 1/2 for extensive
commentary and what the rule does & doesn't spot, which I won't repeat
here.

The 2/2 is then split up to show the effect that "when strict" has on
this.

I noted in [2] that I had a WIP rule to to remove that unused
"get_worktrees()" but couldn't figure out a bug, this coccinelle code
will properly remove that sort of code, but only if it's actually
unused.
