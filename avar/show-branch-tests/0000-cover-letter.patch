Subject: [PATCH 0/4] show-branch: add missing tests, trivial color output fix
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This is a series I've had lying around for a while, when looking at
the color output for show-branch I noticed it reset and re-enabled
color for every single space character.

This fixes that, but mostly fixes the mostly non-existing tests for
that old command it. It still has big blind spots, but now we have
fewer blind spots.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (4):
  show-branch tests: rename the one "show-branch" test file
  show-branch tests: modernize test code
  show-branch: fix and test --color output
  show-branch tests: add missing tests
