That's quite the timing coincidence. I hacked this up yesterday,
thinking that the submodule topic had been too quiet for a while, and
wondering how hard it was to convert the rest of git-submodule.sh.

It's more than 2x the length of yours, but gets to the point where we
can "git rm git-submodule.sh".

Some brief comparison/commentary:

Yeah, this is the alternate approach I considered and ended up
discarding. I.e. to make forward progress with migrating things away
from the cmd_*() functions you either have to prepare things in
advance and then sweep the rug from under them in one go.

Or, as you're doing here teaching them about the options they're
not-really-parsing anymore, but must know about because they're in a
loop that ends with a "if unknown option, usage".

>   submodule update: pass --require-init and --init

Almost the same as my 12/20.

>   submodule--helper update: use one param per type

Same as my 13/20, but I ended up doing it in a more narrow/smaller
way. I tried your way and ran into some bug, then figured I'd do it
more narrowly instead of debugging it.

>   submodule update: remove -v, pass --quiet

Hrm, so we don't need it at all then. Well, that's a bit simpler than
my 1[45]/20 and 17/20 :)

So yeah, definitely RFC-quality, but I ran into that one test that
used -v, and then saw the missing docs etc. But no cheating, so I've
left it in :)

I do wonder if we should leave it in anyway, we never documented -v,
but we *did* understand it, and if you look at:

    git log -p -Gsay -- git-submodule.sh

We used to have a lot more code impacted by it, but looking at this
again now it would have only been for users of command-lines like:

    git submodule --quiet update -v [...]

I.e. where we already set the flag to the non-default quiet, and then
used -v to flip it.

I think at this point I've talked myself into "let's just remove it",
but maybe...

>   submodule update: stop parsing options in .sh

Same effect as my 16/20, but it's the last one I converted, the
cmd_update() case being the trickiest.

>   submodule update: remove never-used expansion

Same as my 02/20, but as seen there I think you missed several
"prefix" non-uses.

Brief commentary on my patches, details in commit messages:

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (20):
  git-submodule.sh: remove unused sanitize_submodule_env()
  git-submodule.sh: remove unused $prefix variable
  git-submodule.sh: remove unused --super-prefix logic

I removed a bit more dead code here than yours.

  git-submodule.sh: normalize parsing of "--branch"
  git-submodule.sh: normalize parsing of --cached

This & various other prep commits (hereafter "easy prep") make
subsequent one-time conversions of whole cmd_*() easier.

  submodule--helper: rename "absorb-git-dirs" to "absorbgitdirs"
  git-submodule.sh: create a "case" dispatch statement

easy prep

  submodule--helper: pretend to be "git submodule" in "-h" output

easy prep & bug fix for existing (on master) output bugs.

  git-submodule.sh: dispatch "sync" to helper
  git-submodule.sh: dispatch directly to helper
  git-submodule.sh: dispatch "foreach" to helper

These are easy conversions as the options 1=1 map after the above
prep.

  submodule--helper: have --require-init imply --init
  submodule--helper: understand --checkout, --merge and --rebase
    synonyms
  git-submodule doc: document the -v" option to "update"
  submodule--helper: understand -v option for "update"

not-so-easy prep for "cmd_update()"

  git-submodule.sh: dispatch "update" to helper

Full cmd_update() migration in one go.

  git-submodule.sh: use "$quiet", not "$GIT_QUIET"

"easy prep", but this one is less overall churn if done at the end,
but as noted above could/should maybe be dropped entirely.

  git-submodule.sh: simplify parsing loop

Not really needed, but I wanted to get the code as close to minimal
for the next step, to eyeball the resulting sh v.s. C version.

  submodule: make it a built-in, remove git-submodule.sh

We now have a builtin/submodule.c *and* the current
builtin/submodule--helper.c, and we even dispatch to "git
submodule--helper" via run_command()!

The idea is to be as close as possible to a bug-for-bug implementation
of the shellscript, and that reviewers should be confident in being
able to trace what commands we invoked before/after, we're invoking
the same "git submodule--helper" commands.

Of course we eventually want to get to some full union of
builtin/submodule{,--helper}.c, but that can wait.

  submodule: add a subprocess-less submodule.useBuiltin setting

Wait, a useBuiltin setting to switch between two built-ins? Yeah,
maybe it makes little sense, but here we get rid of the run_command()
overhead, and could generally use the built-in to experiment with
deeper integration between the two.

Performance is around ~2x faster with the "real" built-in than the
run_command() version, whic hin turn is more than 6x as fast on basic
overhead than the shellscript version, to the extent that anyone cares
about "git submodule" overhead. See [1] at the end for a benchmark.
