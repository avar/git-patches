Subject: [PATCH v3 0/3] bundle doc: generaliz & elaborate
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This started as 1 patch in
https://lore.kernel.org/git/patch-1.1-bc6a6d8922-20210607T165507Z-avarab@gmail.com/
but is now 3.

In rewriting the DESCRIPTION section per Junio's feedback I went on to
elaborate on the thin v.s. not thin bundles and in 3/3 rewrote some
prose to make heavier use of show and tell.

Per a certain recent CodingGuidelines discussion about patterns in our
documentation I've long thought that the sort of change I'm doing in
3/3 is something we could do more of. I.e. replacing somewhat complex
and dense prose with short paragraphs broken up by simple command
examples (and output), whenever possible.

  bundle doc: rewrite the "DESCRIPTION" section
  bundle doc: split out thin v.s. not discussion from <rev-arg>
  bundle doc: elaborate on rev<->ref restriction

         Rewrite the "DESCRIPTION" section for "git bundle" to start by talking
         about what bundles are in general terms, rather than diving directly
    -    into one example of what they might be used for. This changes
    -    documentation that's been substantially the same ever since the
    -    command was added in 2e0afafebd8 (Add git-bundle: move objects and
    -    references by archive, 2007-02-22).

    +    I've split up the DESCRIPTION into that section and a "BUNDLE FORMAT"

    +    The "the user must specify a basis" part of this is discussed below in

    +    brief mention of "thin" suffice.
    +
    +    To the extent that we should say more on the topic that documentation
    +    will be improved by subsequent commits.

    ++Create, unpack, and manipulate "bundle" files. Bundles are used for
    ++the "offline" transfer of Git objects without an active "server"
    ++sitting on the other side of the network connection.
    ++
    ++They can be used to create both incremental and full backups of a
    ++repository, and to relay the state of the references in one repository
    ++to another.
    ++
    ++Other git commands that understand protocols such as `ssh://` and
    ++`https://` can also operate on bundle files. It is possible
    ++linkgit:git-clone[1] a new repository from a bundle, to use
    ++linkgit:git-fetch[1] to fetch from one, and to list the references
    ++contained within it with linkgit:git-ls-remote[1].
    ++
    ++See the "EXAMPLES" section below for examples of how to use bundles.
    ++
    ++BUNDLE FORMAT
    ++-------------
    ++
    ++Bundles are `.pack` files (see linkgit:git-pack-objects[1]) with a
    ++header indicating what references are contained within the bundle. The
    ++header is (mostly) in the format emitted by linkgit:git-show-ref[1].
    ++
     +Like the the packed archive format itself bundles can either be
     +self-contained or thin (see "--thin" in linkgit:git-pack-objects[1]).
     +
    -+Bundles are useful for numerous purposes. They were originally
    -+designed to facilitate the transfer of repository data between
    -+repositories which could not be directly connect to each other, and
    -+therefore the interactive Git protocols (git, ssh, http) could not be
    -+used.
    -+
    -+In that scenario a bundle is produced on the originating machine. It
    -+is then transferred to the other machine (e.g. by sneakernet), and
    -+unpacked on the other end. The unpacking can happen either with
    -+linkgit:git-clone[1] (which knows how to clone from bundle files), or
    -+by "git bundle unbundle".
    - 
    - As no
    - direct connection between the repositories exists, the user must specify a
    -@@ Documentation/git-bundle.txt: basis for the bundle that is held by the destination repository: the
    - bundle assumes that all objects in the basis are already in the
    - destination repository.
    ++See link:technical/bundle-format.html[the `bundle-format`
    ++documentation] for more details.
      
    -+Similarly, bundles are commonly used to produce incremental backups of
    -+git repositories. See the "EXAMPLES" section below.
