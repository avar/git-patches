Subject: [PATCH v3 1/3] bundle doc: rewrite the "DESCRIPTION" section
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Rewrite the "DESCRIPTION" section for "git bundle" to start by talking
about what bundles are in general terms, rather than diving directly
into one example of what they might be used for.

This changes documentation that's been substantially the same ever
since the command was added in 2e0afafebd8 (Add git-bundle: move
objects and references by archive, 2007-02-22).

I've split up the DESCRIPTION into that section and a "BUNDLE FORMAT"
section, it briefly discusses the format, but then links to the
technical/bundle-format.txt documentation.

The "the user must specify a basis" part of this is discussed below in
"SPECIFYING REFERENCES", so I'm removing that part and letting the
brief mention of "thin" suffice.

To the extent that we should say more on the topic that documentation
will be improved by subsequent commits.

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------
 
-Some workflows require that one or more branches of development on one
-machine be replicated on another machine, but the two machines cannot
-be directly connected, and therefore the interactive Git protocols (git,
-ssh, http) cannot be used.
-
-The 'git bundle' command packages objects and references in an archive
-at the originating machine, which can then be imported into another
-repository using 'git fetch', 'git pull', or 'git clone',
-after moving the archive by some means (e.g., by sneakernet).
-
-As no
-direct connection between the repositories exists, the user must specify a
-basis for the bundle that is held by the destination repository: the
-bundle assumes that all objects in the basis are already in the
-destination repository.
+Create, unpack, and manipulate "bundle" files. Bundles are used for
+the "offline" transfer of Git objects without an active "server"
+sitting on the other side of the network connection.
+
+They can be used to create both incremental and full backups of a
+repository, and to relay the state of the references in one repository
+to another.
+
+Other git commands that understand protocols such as `ssh://` and
+`https://` can also operate on bundle files. It is possible
+linkgit:git-clone[1] a new repository from a bundle, to use
+linkgit:git-fetch[1] to fetch from one, and to list the references
+contained within it with linkgit:git-ls-remote[1].
+
+See the "EXAMPLES" section below for examples of how to use bundles.
+
+BUNDLE FORMAT
+-------------
+
+Bundles are `.pack` files (see linkgit:git-pack-objects[1]) with a
+header indicating what references are contained within the bundle. The
+header is (mostly) in the format emitted by linkgit:git-show-ref[1].
+
+Like the the packed archive format itself bundles can either be
+self-contained or thin (see "--thin" in linkgit:git-pack-objects[1]).
+
+See link:technical/bundle-format.html[the `bundle-format`
+documentation] for more details.
