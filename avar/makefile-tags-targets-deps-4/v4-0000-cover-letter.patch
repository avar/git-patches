      ## Commit message ##
    -    Makefile: the "cscope" target always creates a "cscope.out"
    +    Makefile: remove "cscope.out", not "cscope*" in cscope.out target
     
    -    In the preceding commit the "cscope" target was changed to be a phony
    -    alias for the "cscope.out" target.
    +    Before we generate a "cscope.out" file, remove that file explicitly,
    +    and not everything matching "cscope*". This doesn't change any
    +    behavior of the Makefile in practice, but makes this rule less
    +    confusing, and consistent with other similar rules.
     
         The cscope target was added in a2a9150bf06 (makefile: Add a cscope
    -    target, 2007-10-06), and has always referred to cscope* instead of to
    -    cscope.out.
    +    target, 2007-10-06). It has always referred to cscope* instead of to
    +    cscope.out in .gitignore and the "clean" target, even though we only
    +    ever generated a cscope.out file.
     
    -    As far as I can tell this ambiguity was never needed. The
    -    "-fcscope.out" (note, no whitespace) argument is enabled by default,
    -    but let's provide it explicitly for good measure.
    +    This was seemingly done to aid use-cases where someone invoked cscope
    +    with the "-q" flag, which would make it create a "cscope.in.out" and
    +    "cscope.po.out" files in addition to "cscope.out".

    +    But us removing those files we never generated is confusing, so let's
    +    only remove the file we need to, furthermore let's use the "-f" flag
    +    to explicitly name the cscope.out file, even though it's the default
    +    if not "-f" argument is supplied.
    +
    +    It is somewhat inconsistent to change from the glob here but not in
    +    the "clean" rule and .gitignore, an earlier version of this change
    +    updated those as well, but see [1][2] for why they were kept.
