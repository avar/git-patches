Subject: [PATCH v4 00/23] Makefile: dependency fixes, make noop runtime ~1.4x faster
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

As noted in v2[1] this series fixes various dependency issues in the
Makfile. See [2] for before/after benchmark numbers.

This v4 addresses small issues Mike Hommey noted, and clarifies
various questions that came up with updated commit messages.

There's also a fix-for-the-fix here in removing the "hook.c"
dependency on hook-list.h in 19/23.

  Makefile: don't invoke msgfmt with --statistics
  Makefile: don't set up "perl/build" rules under NO_PERL=Y
  Makefile: use "=" not ":=" for po/* and perl/*
  Makefile: clean perl/build/ even with NO_PERL=Y

  Makefile: adjust Perl-related comments & whitespace
  Makefile: correct "GIT-PERL-{DEFINES,HEADER}" dependency graph

  Makefile: stop needing @@GIT_VERSION@@ in *.perl scripts
  Makefiles: add "shared.mak", move ".DELETE_ON_ERROR" to it
  Makefile: move $(comma), $(empty) and $(space) to shared.mak
  Makefile: re-add and use the "shellquote" macros
  Makefile: add a "TRACK_template" for GIT-*{FLAGS,DEFINES,...}
  Makefile: add "$(QUIET)" boilerplate to shared.mak
  Makefile: use $(wspfx) for $(QUIET...) in shared.mak
  Makefiles: add and use wildcard "mkdir -p" template
  Makefile: correct the dependency graph of hook-list.h
  Makefile: use $(file) I/O instead of "FORCE" when possible

    +    This doesn't make much if any of a practical difference, doing this is
    +    cheap either way, but as simply-expanded variables in our Makefile
    +    generally indicate special behavior (e.g. making a copy now, and
    +    modifying the RHS later) let's change these to show that nothing odd
    +    is going on here).

         for GIT-PERL-HEADER.
     
    +    We have had a hard dependency on .DELETE_ON_ERROR since
    +    7b76d6bf221 (Makefile: add and use the ".DELETE_ON_ERROR" flag,
    +    2021-06-29), so this is a pure cleanup as a follow-up to that
    +    commit. Support for the ".DELETE_ON_ERROR" target itself is much older
    +    than any GNU make version we support, it was added to GNU make in
    +    1994.

         benchmark command shows (under --show-output) that we went from ~7716
         syscalls to ~7519, mostly a reduction in [l]stat().
     
    +    We could also invoke make with "-r" by setting "MAKEFLAGS = -r" early,
    +    adding a "-r" variant to the above benchmark shows that it may be 1.01
    +    or so faster (but in my tests, always with a much bigger error
    +    bar). But doing so is a much bigger hammer, since it will disable all
    +    built-in rules, some (all?) of which can be seen with:
    +
    +        make -f/dev/null -p | grep -v -e ^# -e ^$
    +
    +    We may have something that relies on them, so let's go for the more
    +    isolated optimization here that gives us most or all of the wins.
