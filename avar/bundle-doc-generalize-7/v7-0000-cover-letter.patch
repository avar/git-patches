    -+bundle with all the prerequisite objects, as well as providing
    -+negative revisions to exclude prerequisite objects.
    ++When creating bundles it is possible to create a self-contained bundle
    ++that can be unbundled in a repository with no common history, as well
    ++as providing negative revisions to exclude objects needed in the
    ++earlier parts of the history.
     +
    -+A revision such as `new` will produce a tip with all the prerequisite
    -+objects needed for the `new` reference.
    ++Feeding a revision such as `new` to `git bundle create` will create a
    ++bundle file that contains all the objects reachable from the revision
    ++`new`. That bundle can be unbundled in any repository to obtain a full
    ++history that leads to the revision `new`:
     +
    -+A revision range such as `old..new` will produce a bundle tip that'll
    -+require any objects existing before `new` to already be present in the
    -+repository performing the 'git bundle unbundle' operation.
    ++----------------
    ++$ git bundle create full.bundle new

    ++A revision range such as `old..new` will produce a bundle file that
    ++will require the revision `old` (and any objects reachable from it)
    ++to exist for the bundle to be "unbundle"-able:
