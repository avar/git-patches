Subject: [PATCH v2 0/5] describe test fixes
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

As noted in v1 we have a test for "git describe" test that tests for
nothing at all, due to being a nested test_expect_success.

This series is based on my "test-lib.sh fixes" series[2] and fixes
that bug, and should address all feedback on v1. In particular:

 * Shell quoting fixes
 * The "nothing should have stderr" general testing is gone per
   Junio's request.
 * Required test-lib.sh fixes moved to [1]
 * We no longer change the return value of
   test_expect_{success,failure} to narrowly catch the bug being fixed
   here.
 * Ejected SVN test fixup patches, needed for the now-ejected
   test_expect_{success,failure} change. Those fixes still make sense,
   but I'll submit them separately (they don't depend on anything
   else).

I think the "catch the bug" is probably a good idea, but Junio's
suggestion of tracking this via some env variable "stack depth" is
something that would probably collide with t0000*.sh changes I have
unsubmitted/outstanding, and I don't have time to pursue it now. So
I've left that out.

      ## Commit message ##
    -    describe tests: always assert empty stderr from "describe"
    +    describe tests: don't rely on err.actual from "check_describe"
     
    -    Invert a test added in 3291fe4072e (Add git-describe test for "verify
    -    annotated tag names on output", 2008-03-03) to make checking that we
    -    don't have warnings the rule rather than the exception.
    +    Convert the one test that relied on the "err.actual" file produced by
    +    check_describe() to instead do its own check of "git describe"
    +    output.
     
    -    There was only one case where we expected and got a warning. Let's
    -    test for that case explicitly, and assert no warnings or other stderr
    -    output for all the rest.
    +    This means that the two tests won't have an inter-dependency (e.g. if
    +    the earlier test is skipped).
    +
    +    An earlier version of this patch instead asserted that no other test
    +    had any output on stderr. We're not doing that here out of fear that
    +    "gc --auto" or another future change to "git describe" will cause it
    +    to legitimately emit output on stderr unexpectedly[1].
    +
    +    I'd think that inverting the test added in 3291fe4072e (Add
    +    git-describe test for "verify annotated tag names on output",
    +    2008-03-03) to make checking that we don't have warnings the rule
    +    rather than the exception would be the sort of thing the describe
    +    tests should be catching, but for now let's leave it as it is.
