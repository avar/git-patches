Subject: [PATCH 0/2] i18n: improve translatability of ambiguous object output
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This series improves the translatability of the output we emit when an
ambiguous OID is given by not emitting it a line-at-a-time. This
likely won't matter in practice except for RTL languages (of which we
have no current translations), but it's good to be future-proof!

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (2):
  object-name tests: tighten up advise() output test
  object-name: make ambiguous object output translatable
