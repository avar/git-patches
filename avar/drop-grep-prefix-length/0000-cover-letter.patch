Subject: [PATCH 0/8] grep: simplify & delete code by changing obscure cfg variable behavior
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

I'd like to use the grep API for more things in some upcoming
optimization patches, and to do that I need to use grep_init(),
grep_config() etc.

These APIs have a very unusual API, and we've got quite a bit of code
in grep.c to support an obscure edge case in how "grep.extendedRegexp"
behaves when clashing with a "grep.patternType" variable present in
the same config space.

This series is an opinionated change of that behavior, and resulting
large deletion of code.

The series starts out by deleting some unused code in grep.c, and
moving a bit of related builtin/grep.c-specific code to that file, and
out of grep.c.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (8):
  grep.h: remove unused "regex_t regexp" from grep_opt
  git.c & grep.c: assert that "prefix" is NULL or non-zero string
  grep: remove unused "prefix_length" member
  grep.c: move "prefix" out of "struct grep_opt"
  log tests: check if grep_config() is called by "log"-like cmds
  grep API: call grep_config() after grep_init()
  grep: simplify config parsing, change grep.<rx config> interaction
  grep: make "extendedRegexp=true" the same as "patternType=extended"
