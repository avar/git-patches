Subject: [PATCH 0/2] bundle tests: modernize, fix missing coverage & test_cmp
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

A trivial series to improve the bundle tests a bit. This is split off
from some larger changes to "git bundle" I have cooking, where the
"test_cmp" in 2/2 helped assert & catch regressions.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (2):
  bundle tests: use ">file" not ": >file"
  bundle tests: use test_cmp instead of grep
