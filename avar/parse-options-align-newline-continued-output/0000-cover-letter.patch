Subject: [PATCH 0/2] parse-options: properly align continued usage output
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This series changes usage_with_options_internal() in parse-options.c
to properly align continued "\n" usage output.

Before this change some built-ins using the API effectively tried to
hack around the lack of such alignment, with some getting it wrong,
and some getting it right. Others such as "git stash -h" didn't at
all, and their continued "\n" output would always look weirdly
misaligned. Now the output all looks nice!

This came about from following the thread of "why we we even have '\n'
here at all?", which is a question I had in my own mind around
