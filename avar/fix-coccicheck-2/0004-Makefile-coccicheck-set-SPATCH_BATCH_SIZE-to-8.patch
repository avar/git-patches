Subject: [PATCH v2 4/4] Makefile/coccicheck: set SPATCH_BATCH_SIZE to 8
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Change the "xargs -n X" limit for running spatch from 1 to 8, as
suggested by Jeff King[1]. Now that we're not using --all-includes
anymore this is going to take much less memory, so bumping the limit
should be OK.
