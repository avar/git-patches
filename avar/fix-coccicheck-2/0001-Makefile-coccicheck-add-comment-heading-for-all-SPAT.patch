Subject: [PATCH v2 1/4] Makefile/coccicheck: add comment heading for all
 SPATCH flags
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

In 960154b9c17 (coccicheck: optionally batch spatch invocations,
2019-05-06) the comment being re-added here was amended and reworded
to apply to the SPATCH_BATCH_SIZE variable.

If we'd like a separate comment on SPATCH_FLAGS now the diff to
introduce it will need to also move the comment. So add this heading
back to make subsequent diffs smaller.
