Subject: [PATCH 0/2] string-list.h: make "nr" and "alloc" a "size_t"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

$subject most recently came up in
https://lore.kernel.org/git/220305.86pmn030ou.gmgdl@evledraar.gmail.com/. I.e. we
have code in-tree already that's possibly (although in that case
unlikely to in practice) keeping track of size_t-indexed with a
string_list's "unsigned int"-indexed data.

Now there are no textual or semantic conflicts between this change and
"seen", so having series (which is of course based on "master") now
would be a good thing, and help to future-proof the API.

The 1/2 here isn't strictly neccesary as part of this series, but
since a large part 2/2 is adjusting the same sort of Q_() patterns I
thought it made sense to both show existing PRIuMAX use in those
macros, and how we do those casts.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (2):
  gettext API users: correct use of casts for Q_()
  string-list API: change "nr" and "alloc" to "size_t"
