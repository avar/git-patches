Subject: [PATCH v3 5/9] notes docs: de-duplicate and combine configuration
 sections
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Combine the various "notes" configuration sections spread across
Documentation/config/notes.txt and Documentation/git-notes.txt to live
in the former, and to be included in the latter.

We'll now forward link from "git notes" to the "CONFIGURATION" section
below, rather than to "git-config(1)" when discussing configuration
variables that are (also) discussed in that section.
