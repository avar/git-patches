Subject: [PATCH 0/5] COPYING: modernize, steal boilerplate from linux.git
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

There's patches to git.git to add a BSD-licensed reftable/ directory
with its own "COPYING" file[1]. I think that for such a thing to be
in-tree we should have some note in the top-level "COPYING" explaining
git's license, but that subdirectories or other files could be under
their own licenses.

This series reaches the end-state of pretty much stealing linux.git's
"COPYING" file, including specific wording they have. linux.git used
to have pretty much git.git's "COPYING" file (as git.git's was derived
from an older version), but has since diverged.

In linux.git there's a reference to
"Documentation/process/license-rules.rst", this new COPYING file
covers the relevant parts inline, but like linux.git's the end-state
is that the GPLv2 is not inline in the "COPYING" file anymore, instead
it's split into a GPL-2.0" and referenced by it.

The "meaty" part of this series (which I've CC'd Linus, Greg & Mauro,
who were involved in the linux.git changes) is 3-5/5. The first two
patches are just dealing with the implementation detail that git.git's
"COPYING" file happened to be used by its test suite as test data, it
couldn't be changed significantly without changing those (mostly "git
diffdiff") tests.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (5):
  "lib-diff" tests: make "README" and "COPYING" test data smaller
  tests: stop using top-level "README" and "COPYING" files
  COPYING: remove mention of GPLv3, clarify sub-project COPYING
  COPYING: move GPL text to a "GPL-2.0" file
  GPL-2.0: update to byte-for-byte match the FSF's version
