         tests: add missing double quotes to included library paths
     
    -    Fix two inclusions added in d42bab442d7 (core.fsyncmethod: tests for
    -    batch mode, 2022-04-04) that needed to be quoted, and the same sort of
    -    issue in a242c150ebb (vimdiff: integrate layout tests in the unit
    -    tests framework ('t' folder), 2022-03-30). Both were first released
    -    with v2.37.0-rc0.
    +    Fix inclusion errors which would occur if the $TEST_DIRECTORY had $IFS
    +    whitespace in it.
    +
    +    See d42bab442d7 (core.fsyncmethod: tests for batch mode, 2022-04-04)
    +    and a242c150ebb (vimdiff: integrate layout tests in the unit tests
    +    framework ('t' folder), 2022-03-30) for the two relevant commits. Both
    +    were first released with v2.37.0-rc0 (and were also part of v2.37.0).
