Subject: [PATCH v2 0/3] gitweb: Be smarter about linking to SHA1s in log messages
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This is v2 of patches I sent on September 21st starting at
<20160921114428.28664-1-avarab@gmail.com>. Jakub Narębski had a lot of
feedback for that series (thanks!). Which as far as I can tell I've
incorporated entirely in this re-roll.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (3):
  gitweb: Fix a typo in a comment
  gitweb: Link to 7-char+ SHA1s, not only 8-char+
  gitweb: Link to "git describe"'d commits in log messages
