Subject: [PATCH v5 09/10] Makefile: document default SHA-1 backend on OSX
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Since [1] the default SHA-1 backend on OSX has been
APPLE_COMMON_CRYPTO. Per [2] we'll skip using it on anything older
than Mac OS X 10.4 "Tiger"[3].

When "DC_SHA1" was made the default in [4] this interaction between it
and APPLE_COMMON_CRYPTO seems to have been missed in. Ever since
DC_SHA1 was "made the default" we've still used Apple's CommonCrypto
instead of sha1collisiondetection on modern versions of Darwin and
OSX.

1. 61067954ce1 (cache.h: eliminate SHA-1 deprecation warnings on Mac
   OS X, 2013-05-19)
2. 9c7a0beee09 (config.mak.uname: set NO_APPLE_COMMON_CRYPTO on older
   systems, 2014-08-15)
3. We could probably drop "NO_APPLE_COMMON_CRYPTO", as nobody's likely
   to care about such on old version of OSX anymore. But let's leave that
   for now.
