Subject: [PATCH 0/4] test-lib: improve LSAN + ASAN stack traces
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This small series provides a much needed UX improvement for
SANITIZE=leak stack traces. As noted in 4/4 this makes LSAN around 10%
slower, but in some cases the stack traces we show now are useless, so
I think it's worth it.

This also changes the stack traces to strip the absolute path to the
build directory from them. See 3/4 for how much better that looks.

This series is a result of a suggestion by Jeff King in [1], when some
of these bad stack traces (which for anyone re-reading that, I had the
wrong idea about, we just needed fast_unwind_on_malloc=0) were
discussed.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (4):
  test-lib: add XSAN_OPTIONS, inherit [AL]SAN_OPTIONS
  test-lib: make $GIT_BUILD_DIR an absolute path
  test-lib: add "strip_path_prefix" to XSAN_OPTIONS
  test-lib: add "fast_unwind_on_malloc=0" to LSAN_OPTIONS
