Subject: [PATCH 0/2] fixups for issues in next-merged ab/cat-file
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This series goes on top of ab/cat-file, which was merged to next in
e145efa6059 (Merge branch 'ab/cat-file' into next, 2022-01-05).

The first commit addresses an issue Jiang Xin raised in
https://lore.kernel.org/git/CANYiYbEYgSCx230S29zVhMKb8J8WQ1ScxVHn6fMvdhPOdjpBCg@mail.gmail.com/

The second fixes a typo of mine when referring to an option name that
I spotted while preparing this.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (2):
  cat-file: don't whitespace-pad "(...)" in SYNOPSIS and usage output
  cat-file: s/_/-/ in typo'd usage_msg_optf() message
