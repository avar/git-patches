Subject: [PATCH 0/2] For v2.37.0: rename fetch.credentialsInUrl to transfer.credentialsInUrl
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The $subject is a case where nothing is broken except potential user
expectations, but as argued in 2/2 I think we really should rename
this before we kick it out the door.

Having a "fetch" configuration configure "git push" is really
confusing, and once we need to support it backing out of it would be a
hassle.

Then 1/2 clarifies how it really works, and what it's aimed to do, and
notes the major caveat that the check doesn't cover "pushurl"
configuration, which in some setups is the only place you'll put
passwords in URLs. I think it likewise makes sense to have that in
v2.37.0 so we won't lull users into a false sense of security.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (2):
  fetch doc: note "pushurl" caveat about "credentialsInUrl", elaborate
  transfer doc: move fetch.credentialsInUrl to "transfer" config
    namespace
