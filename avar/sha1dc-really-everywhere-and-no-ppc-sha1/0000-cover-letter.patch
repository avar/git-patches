    -    ppc: remove custom SHA-1 implementation
    +    Makefile + hash.h: remove PPC_SHA1 implementation
     
         Remove the PPC_SHA1 implementation added in a6ef3518f9a ([PATCH] PPC
         assembly implementation of SHA1, 2005-04-22). When this was added
         Apple consumer hardware used the PPC architecture, and the
         implementation was intended to improve SHA-1 speed there.
     
    -    Since it was added we've moved to DC_SHA1 by default, and anyone
    -    wanting hard-rolled non-DC SHA-1 implementation can use OpenSSL's via
    -    the OPENSSL_SHA1 knob.
    +    Since it was added we've moved to using sha1collisiondetection by
    +    default, and anyone wanting hard-rolled non-DC SHA-1 implementation
    +    can use OpenSSL's via the OPENSSL_SHA1 knob.
     
    -    I'm unsure if this was ever supposed to work on 64-bit PPC. It clearly
    -    originally targeted 32 bit PPC, but there's some mailing list
    -    references to this being tried on G5 (PPC 970). I can't get it to do
    -    anything but segfault on the BE POWER8 machine in the GCC compile
    -    farm. Anyone caring about speed on PPC these days is likely to be
    -    using IBM's POWER, not PPC 970.
    +    Furthermore this doesn't run on the modern PPC processors which anyone
    +    who's concerned about performance on PPC is likely to be using these
    +    days, i.e. the IBM POWER series. It originally originally targeted 32
    +    bit PPC, but there's some mailing list references to this being tried
    +    on G5 (PPC 970).
     
    -    There have been proposals to entirely remove non-DC_SHA1
    +    I can't get it to do anything but segfault on both the BE and LE POWER
    +    machines in the GCC compile farm.
    +
    +    There have been proposals to entirely remove non-sha1collisiondetection
         implementations from the tree[1]. I think per [2] that would be a bit
         overzealous. I.e. there are various set-ups git's speed is going to be
         more important than the relatively implausible SHA-1 collision attack,
         or where such attacks are entirely mitigated by other means (e.g. by
         incoming objects being checked with DC_SHA1).
     
    -    The main reason for doing so at this point is to simplify follow-up
    -    Makefile change. Since PPC_SHA1 included the only in-tree *.S assembly
    -    file we needed to keep around special support for building objects
    -    from it. By getting rid of it we know we'll always build *.o from *.c
    -    files, which makes the build process simpler.
    +    But that really doesn't apply to PPC_SHA1 in particular, which seems
    +    to have outlived its usefulness.
    +
    +    As this gets rid of the only in-tree *.S assembly file we can remove
    +    the small bits of logic from the Makefile needed to build objects
    +    from *.S (as opposed to *.c)
     
    -    As an aside the code being removed here was also throwing warnings
    -    with the "-pedantic" flag, but let's remove it instead of fixing it,
    -    as 544d93bc3b4 (block-sha1: remove use of obsolete x86 assembly,
    -    2022-03-10) did for block-sha1/*.
