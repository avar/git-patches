Subject: [PATCH 02/25] CI: make "$jobname" explicit, remove fallback
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Remove the $jobname fallback last adjusted in b011fabd6e0 (ci/lib.sh:
encapsulate Travis-specific things, 2019-01-27).

This makes all of our CI jobs have an explicit $jobname, and removes
the special-case of the Windows jobs implicitly setting one (that they
don't currently use). In subsequent commits we'll use this new
$jobname explicitly.

This is a follow-up to my 25715419bf4 (CI: don't run "make test" twice
in one job, 2021-11-23), since then all the jobs except the Windows
jobs have had an explicit $jobname.

In the case of the Windows jobs we were using a jobname of windows-gcc
for both, due to picking "gcc" as a default fallback for "$CC" in
ci/lib.sh.

Since we'll need this to run ci/lib.sh it makes sense to move the
check to the top of the file. Subsequent commits will add more such
assertions to it.
