Subject: [PATCH 00/25] CI: run "make [test]" directly, use $GITHUB_ENV
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

== Applying this

Merging this has a trivial conflct with "seen"'s
js/use-builtin-add-i. The
s/GIT_TEST_ADD_I_USE_BUILTIN=1/GIT_TEST_ADD_I_USE_BUILTIN=0/g" there
needs to be correspondingly changed (using "setenv", no "export") in
ci/lib.sh

== Summary

This series makes the CI less of a special-case by getting rid of
wrapper scripts like "ci/run-build-and-tests.sh" in favor of simply
running "make" or "make test" directly.

It also has changes that make us do less special-ness in
CI. E.g. there's now a "make ci-static-analysis" target that can be
run locally to do what "ci/run-static-analysis.sh" did before. The CI
just invokes that new "make" target, and the
"ci/run-static-analysis.sh" script has been "git rm'd".

The 12/25 here has a more detailed summary[1], but basically the
"ci/lib.sh" is now a script run directly from an early CI step within
a given job. That script runs sets the environment variables needed in
$GITHUB_ENV (what GitHub CI uses to carry forward the environment
between steps).

== Details

This series conflicts with and is a proposed alternative to Johannes's
proposed changes to teach "ci/lib.sh" GitHub specific syntax to
"group" certain parts of the output[2]. That series proposes to keep
the "ci/run-build-and-tests.sh" and similar scripts, but to teach them
to emit markers indicating when the "build" part commences, then
"test" etc.

I think the approach offered here is better as elaborated on in
12/25[1], especially because as Johannes notes[3] we only have one
level of "grouping" within a "step" available to us. In his version
using it for "build" v.s. "test" precludes being able to group parts
of that "build" or "test" output in the future.

The following compares CI output between the three with a
change-on-top which caused a compilation error ("this" is this series,
"js" is Johannes's) when clicking on the "linux-gcc" failure:

  master: https://github.com/avar/git/runs/5274251909?check_suite_focus=true
  this: https://github.com/avar/git/runs/5274464670?check_suite_focus=true
  js: https://github.com/avar/git/runs/5272239403?check_suite_focus=true

  Here we went from 93 lines of output on "master" to 47 in "this"
  (107 in "js"). Note also how in "this" we can:

  - Expand the "Run make" to get the "MAKEFLAGS" and other variables
    used in the step. That's now a 3-line summary instead of the
    first 50 lines being the old "ci/lib.sh" "set -x" output.

  - Because "make" failed, we have an elided "make test" step that's
    not being run visible below.

  - Unlike the "js" version we'll show the compilation error by
    default (the "js" version is grouped and needs to be expanded),
    but our output is now brief enough that that's no longer
    surrounded by other irrelevant output.

  - Unlike the "js" version there is no "CI setup" group within each
    step. That work is in the earlier "ci/lib.sh --build" step
    instead, which sets the config for all subsequent steps.

For other output changes look at the difference between "master" and
"this" at:

  master: https://github.com/git/git/actions/runs/1866786595
  this: https://github.com/avar/git/actions/runs/1876270588

Not explicitly covered in the summary above is that various other
parts of ci/* were doing the same sort of within-step setup, but now
do so via cross-step passing of variables via $GITHUB_ENV. E.g. on
"master" the test slices for the Windows tests have a lot of verbosity
before they get to running the test itself:

    https://github.com/git/git/runs/5254267914?check_suite_focus=true#step:5:56

In the "js" version the test output is hidden ("grouped"), but we've
got the same amount of verbosity by default:

    https://github.com/gitgitgadget/git/runs/4937491771?check_suite_focus=true#step:5:67

Whereas in "this" version that verbosity is in the preceding "select
tests" step, with the "test" step showing only the relevant end-state
of the "$T" variable we'll use in the Makefile:

    https://github.com/avar/git/runs/5274558869?check_suite_focus=true#step:7:1

This series does not attempt to replace the use of the "group" output
used for the "ok" or "not ok" portion of tests in Johannes's
series. When a test fails the output in this series (sans config
discovery not being repeated, and now summarized in the $GITHUB_ENV
drop-down) is substantially the same as on "master".

My summary at [4] goes into other overlap & non-overlap between the
two. I think using the "group" output for those purposes might be
useful, although I left some feedback on [5] with problems in the
current implementation.
