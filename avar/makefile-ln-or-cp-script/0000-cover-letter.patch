Subject: [PATCH 0/6] Makefile: make non-symlink & non-hardlink install sane
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This series introduces no "real" behavior changes I'd expect anyone to
notice, but refactors a lengthy copy/pasted test/if/else in the
Makefile into a simple helper script.

The "real" behavior change is that we no longer ask the user how
they'd like to install (symlinks, hardlinks, neither?) and then
proceed to ignore what was asked of us and optimistically fallback in
case of errors. I.e. the inability to create symlinks or hardlinks.

Instead we'll just die, the old behavior is still available as
INSTALL_FALLBACK_LN_CP. In practice I think exactly nobody actually
wanted the existing behavior.

It's just something that emerged over almost 2 decades of first
wanting to have the ability to specify such a fallback, and then
adding e.g. support for INSTALL_SYMLINKS along the way.

There's also side-discussion of a bug I discovered along the way in
SKIP_DASHED_BUILT_INS in 4/6. This series doesn't make that bug better
or worse, but it interacts with the flags being changed here.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (6):
  Makefile: symlink the same way under "symlinks" and "no hardlinks"
  Makefile: begin refactoring out "ln || ln -s || cp" pattern
  Makefile: refactor out "ln || ln -s || cp" pattern
  Makefile: make INSTALL_SYMLINKS affect the build directory
  Makefile: use "ln -f" instead of "rm && ln"
  Makefile: add a INSTALL_FALLBACK_LN_CP mode
