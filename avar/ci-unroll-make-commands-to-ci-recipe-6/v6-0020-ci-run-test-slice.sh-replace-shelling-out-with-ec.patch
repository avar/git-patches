Subject: [PATCH v6 20/29] ci/run-test-slice.sh: replace shelling out with
 "echo"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Amend this code added in b819f1d2cec (ci: parallelize testing on
Windows, 2019-01-29) to stop shelling out to "tr", all we're trying to
do here is to turn '\n'-delimited output into a ' '-delimited list. To
do that we can just use "echo".

None of these files will contain the odd characters using "echo" might
choke on in the general case (i.e. '\'-escapes and the like).

This has the added benefit of not adding a redundant ' ' to the end of
the T-parameter, which didn't matter in practice, but as we'll see in
a subsequent commit makes for slightly nicer output, as we'll show
this variable using a GitHub CI-native feature.
