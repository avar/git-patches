Subject: [PATCH v6 16/29] CI: invoke "make artifacts-tar" directly in
 windows-build
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Change the windows-build job to invoke the "make artifacts-tar" step
directly, instead of calling a "ci/make-test-artifacts.sh" script.

The script was needed because "ci/lib.sh" would set up various
environment variables for us, but now we can instead use the
"ci/lib.sh" in its script mode.

The "mkdir -p" added in b819f1d2cec (ci: parallelize testing on
Windows, 2019-01-29) isn't needed, the same commit added that "mkdir
-p" to the "artifacts-tar" rule itself, so we can have "make" create
the directory for us.

This also has the benefit of making the "build" step less chatty,
since it won't start with the verbose "set -x" output, that's now
contained in the "ci/lib.sh" step.
