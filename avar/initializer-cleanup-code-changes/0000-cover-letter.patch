Subject: [PATCH 0/6] Non-trivial designated initializer conversion
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

A sister series to the just-submitted series of trivial designated
initalizer cleanups:
https://lore.kernel.org/git/cover-0.5-00000000000-20210927T003330Z-avarab@gmail.com/

This doesn't conflict semantically or textually with that series, but
is migrating to easier to manage initialization patterns for the same
reasons.

The code changes are all rather small, the diff in 6/6 looks scary,
but as --word-diff will show most of it schanging x->y to an &x->y and
the like, as two struct members were changed from being pointers.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (6):
  daemon.c: refactor hostinfo_init() to HOSTINFO_INIT macro
  builtin/blame.c: refactor commit_info_init() to COMMIT_INFO_INIT macro
  shortlog: use designated initializer for "struct shortlog"
  urlmatch.[ch]: add and use URLMATCH_CONFIG_INIT
  builtin/remote.c: add and use a REF_STATES_INIT
  builtin/remote.c: add and use SHOW_INFO_INIT
