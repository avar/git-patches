Subject: [PATCH v4 14/22] fsck.c: undefine temporary STR macro after use
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

In f417eed8cde (fsck: provide a function to parse fsck message IDs,
2015-06-22) the "STR" macro was introduced, but that short macro name
was not undefined after use as was done earlier in the same series for
the MSG_ID macro in c99ba492f1c (fsck: introduce identifiers for fsck
messages, 2015-06-22).
