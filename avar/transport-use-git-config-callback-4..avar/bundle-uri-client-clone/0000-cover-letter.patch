Subject: [RFC PATCH 00/13] Add bundle-uri: resumably clones, static "dumb" CDN etc.
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

We're in the 2.33.0 rc cycle, and I'd hoped to have some more prep
work for this integrated already, but for now here's something
interesting I've been working on for early commentary/feedback.

This adds the the ability to protocol v2 for servers to optimistically
pre-seed supporting clients with one or more bundles via a new
"bundle-uri" protocol extension.

Right now only "clone" supports this, but it's a rather easy change on
top to add incremental "fetch" support as well.

The elevator pitch for this feature is (I guess it's a long elevator
ride..);

 * Allows for offloading most/all of a PACK "fetch" to "dumb" CDN's
   that *don't* have very close coordination with the server running
   "git-upload-pack" (unlike packfile-uri, more on that below).

   I.e. distributing an up-to-date-enough bundle via something like
   Debian's FTP mirror system, or a best-effort occasionally updated
   CDN.

   Should the bundle(s) be outdated, corrupt or whatever the client
   gracefully recovers by either ignoring the bad data, or catching up
   via negotiation with whatever data it did get.

   Server operators should be confident in using bundle URIs, even if
   the CDN they're pointing to is flaky, out of date, or even
   sometimes outright broken or unreachable. The client will recover
   in all those cases.

 * Makes performant git infrastructure more accessible, i.e. this
   feature helps the last with an up-to-date repack with up-to-date
   bitmaps when talking to a network-local git server, but a lot of
   users have more option for scaling or distributing things via dumb
   CDNs than a server that can run "git-upload-pack".

 * You can even bootstrap a clone of a remote server that doesn't
   support bundle-uri with a local or remote bundle with the
   "transfer.injectBundleURI" config.

 * Trivial path to resumable clones. Note that that's "resumable" in
   the sense that curl(1) will resume a partially downloaded bundle,
   we don't resume whatever state index-pack was in when the
   connection was broken.

   I have a POC of this working locally, it's just a matter of
   invoking curl(1) with "--continue-at -".

   The hindrance for resumably clones is now just the UI for git-clone
   (i.e. stashing the partial data somewhere), not protocol
   limitations.

This goes on top of the outstanding series I have for serve.c API
cleanup & fixes at
https://lore.kernel.org/git/cover-v4-00.10-00000000000-20210805T011823Z-avarab@gmail.com

I also needed to grab one patch from my "bundle unbundle progress"
series:
https://lore.kernel.org/git/cover-0.4-0000000000-20210727T004015Z-avarab@gmail.com/

Something like this approach had been suggested before in late 2011 by
Jeff King, see:
https://lore.kernel.org/git/20111110074330.GA27925@sigill.intra.peff.net/;
There's significant differences in the approach, mainly due to
protocol v2 not existing at the time. I wrote most of this before
finding/seeing Jeff's earlier patches.

For a demo of how this works head over to 12/13:
https://lore.kernel.org/git/RFC-patch-12.13-8dc5613e87-20210805T150534Z-avarab@gmail.com

In 13/13 there's a design doc discussing the approach, and major
differences with the existing packfile-uri mechanism:
https://lore.kernel.org/git/RFC-patch-13.13-1e657ed27a-20210805T150534Z-avarab@gmail.com

This can also be grabbed from the "avar/bundle-uri-client-clone"
branch of https://github.com/avar/git/
