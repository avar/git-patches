Subject: [PATCH 0/5] usage API: add and use a bug() + BUG_if_bug()
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This series adds a bug() (lower-case) function to go along with
BUG(). As seen in 2-5/5 this makes it much easier to handle the cases
such as parse-options.c where we'd like to call BUG(), but would like
to first exhaustively accumulate the N issues we spot before doing so,
and not merely BUG() out on the first one.

I have more fixes for parse-options.c queued up on top of this
locally, including a fix for one (tiny) recent-ish regression, but
found that it was much easier to do so with this new API, as we'll now
be able to freely use normal sprintf() formats in these cases, instead
of xstrfmt() (where we'd also memory leak).

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (5):
  usage.c: add a non-fatal bug() function to go with BUG()
  parse-options.c: use new bug() API for optbug()
  parse-options.c: use optbug() instead of BUG() "opts" check
  receive-pack: use bug() and BUG_if_bug()
  cache-tree.c: use bug() and BUG_if_bug()
