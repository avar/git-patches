See <20170523192453.14172-1-avarab@gmail.com> for v2
(https://public-inbox.org/git/20170523192453.14172-1-avarab@gmail.com/).

This on top of "[PATCH v4 00/31] Easy to review grep & pre-PCRE
changes".

This hopefully addresses all the comments I had on v2. Comments below:

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (7):
  grep: don't redundantly compile throwaway patterns under threading
  grep: skip pthreads overhead when using one thread
  log: add -P as a synonym for --perl-regexp

No changes.

  grep: add support for the PCRE v1 JIT API

 * Simplify logic around canjit variable.

 * s/BUG: // for things that aren't internal bugs (but keep it for one
   that's an actual bug if it happens...)

 * Simplify syntax around `#ifdef PCRE_CONFIG_JIT` blocks.

  grep: un-break building with PCRE < 8.32

 * Reword commit message for less confusion.

 * Macro name: s/GIT_PCRE1_CAN_DO_MODERN_JIT/GIT_PCRE1_USE_JIT/g

  grep: un-break building with PCRE < 8.20

No changes.

  grep: add support for PCRE v2

 * Makefile: Clarify comment about what LIBPCREDIR=* does now.

 * Makefile: One use of USE_LIBPCRE is now USE_LIBPCRE1. It's
   logically the same, but less confusing now.

 * grep.c: Fix up comment syntax

 * grep.c: Same canjit & s/BUG: // bug fixes as noted for PCRE v1.
