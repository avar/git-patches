Subject: [PATCH 0/2] pack-objects: missing tests & --stdin-packs segfault fix
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

When re-rolling an unrelated series[1] dealing with pack-objects.c and
revision.c I discovered that we have some test blindspots, and that
the newly added --stdin-packs option in v2.32.0 will segfault if fed
garbage data.

This fixes the test blindspots, and 2/2 fixes the segfault.

As discussed in its commit message I'm being lazy about emitting the
error message. If you supply N bogus lines on stdin we'll error on the
first one, since the input is first sorted by the string-list.c
API. The test case for the error message relies on which of two SHA
lines sorts first, and I picked input that happens to sort the same
way under both SHA-1 and SHA-256.

Lazy, but I figured for this use-case it wasn't worth keeping track of
what line we saw when, or to refactor the parsing check on pack names
as we get input lines.
