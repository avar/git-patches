      ## Commit message ##
    -    COPYING: remove mention of GPLv3, clarify sub-project COPYING
    +    unpack-trees: don't leak memory in verify_clean_subdirectory()
     
    -    The COPYING file added in [1] is a product of its era, at the time
    -    discussions around the GPLv3 were quite active. Since then we have had
    -    almost on "GPL v2 or later" notices anywhere.
    +    Fix two different but related memory leaks in
    +    verify_clean_subdirectory(). We leaked both the "pathbuf" if
    +    read_directory() returned non-zero, and we never cleaned up our own
    +    "struct dir_struct" either.
     
    -    Since then[2][3] linux.git has replaced its version of almost the
    -    identical wording with something that's a bit more formal, and which
    -    isn't mostly addressing a hypothetical future GPL v3 migratin. Let's
    -    do the same. Now we:
    +     * "pathbuf": When the read_directory() call followed by the
    +       free(pathbuf) was added in c81935348be (Fix switching to a branch
    +       with D/F when current branch has file D., 2007-03-15) we didn't
    +       bother to free() before we called die().
     
    -    A. Let it suffice to say that things are licensed under GPL v2 unless
    -       explicitly otherwise stated. The new wording is an amalgamation of
    -       the start of Linux's "COPYING" file[4] and the end of our pre-image
    -       first paragraph added in[1].
    +       But when this code was later libified in 203a2fe1170 (Allow callers
    +       of unpack_trees() to handle failure, 2008-02-07) we started to leak
    +       as we returned data to the caller. This fixes that memory leak,
    +       which can be observed under SANITIZE=leak with e.g. the
    +       "t1001-read-tree-m-2way.sh" test.
     
    -    B. Add some brief wording about how the licenses of subdirectories
    -       such as "sha1dc/" and "compat/regex/" should be discovered. This is
    -       also intended to cover future in-tree additions such as the
    -       "reftable" directory[5][6].
    +     * "struct dir_struct": We've leaked the dir_struct ever since this
    +       code was added back in c81935348be.
     
    -    C. Include the same "subject to this COPYING file" wording as
    -       linux.git has used since[7].
    +       When that commit was written there wasn't an equivalent of
    +       dir_clear(). Since it was added in 270be816049 (dir.c: provide
    +       clear_directory() for reclaiming dir_struct memory, 2013-01-06)
    +       we've omitted freeing the memory allocated here.
     
    -    1. 075b845a857 (Add a COPYING notice, making it explicit that the
    -       license is GPLv2., 2005-04-11)
    -    2. torvalds/linux@bf02d491237e (COPYING: use the new text with points
    -       to the license files, 2018-03-23)
    -    3. torvalds/linux@74835c7db032 (COPYING: state that all contributions
    -       really are covered by this file, 2020-02-06)
    -    4. torvalds/linux@88de995ccf48 (COPYING: create a new file with points
    -       to the Kernel license files, 2018-03-23)
    -    5. https://lore.kernel.org/git/2597ddfeae1d9da8695151f62379c85621ad0fcb.1632841817.git.gitgitgadget@gmail.com/
    -    6. https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqqtui4k1j5.fsf@gitster.g/
    -    7. torvalds/linux@74835c7db032 (COPYING: state that all contributions
    -       really are covered by this file, 2020-02-06)
    +       This memory leak could also be observed under SANITIZE=leak and the
    +       "t1001-read-tree-m-2way.sh" test.
    +
    +    This makes all the test in "t1001-read-tree-m-2way.sh" pass under
    +    "GIT_TEST_PASSING_SANITIZE_LEAK=true", we'd previously die in tests
    +    25, 26 & 28.
