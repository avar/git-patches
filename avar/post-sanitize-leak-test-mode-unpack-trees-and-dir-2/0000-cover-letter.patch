Subject: [PATCH 0/2] dir & unpak-trees: memory-leak fixes
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

These couple of patches fix some remaining memory leaks in
unpack-trees.c, which mostly happen via a lack of calls to dir_clear()
fixed in 2/2.

This goes on top of ab/sanitize-leak-ci (but not
en/removing-untracked-fixes). In 1/2 I mark a test as passing under
SANITIZE=leak, which assumes that an environment variable added by
ab/sanitize-leak-ci is understood. Without ab/sanitize-leak-ci it'll
be silently ignored.

Elijah has parallel work in fixing leaks in dir.c, but without his
ab/sanitize-leak-ci that test will also pass, it's not one of the ones
that needed something like his leak fixes to {dir,unpack-trees}.c to
pass.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (2):
  unpack-trees: don't leak memory in verify_clean_subdirectory()
  built-ins & lib: plug memory leaks with unpack_trees_options_release()
