Subject: [PATCH 0/3] grep: PCRE JIT fixes
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

There's a couple of patches fixing mistakes in the JIT code I added
for PCRE in <20190722181923.21572-1-dev+git@drbeat.li> and
<20190721194052.15440-1-carenas@gmail.com>

This small series proposes to replace both of those. In both cases I
think we're better off just removing the relevant code. The commit
messages for the patches themselves make the case for that.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (3):
  grep: remove overly paranoid BUG(...) code
  grep: stop "using" a custom JIT stack with PCRE v2
  grep: stop using a custom JIT stack with PCRE v1
