I do the same at Booking.com (although at a more ad-hoc schedule) and
got the report whose fix is now sitting in "pu" noted upthread.

I fear that these sorts of corporate environments, both Google's and
Booking's, end up testing a relatively narrow featureset. Most people
have similar enough workflows, e.g. just using "git pull --rebase",
I'd be surprised if we have more than 2-3 internal users who ever use
the --onto option for example.

That's a good question, one which I don't think we knew the answer to
before the following patches. As it turns out no, we still run the
tests without failures with GIT_TEST_REBASE_USE_BUILTIN=false.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (2):
  rebase doc: document rebase.useBuiltin
  tests: add a special setup where rebase.useBuiltin is off
