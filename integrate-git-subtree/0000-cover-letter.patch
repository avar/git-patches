Subject: [PATCH 0/4] subtree: move out of contrib
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

I think at this point git-subtree is widely used enough to move out of
contrib/, maybe others disagree, but patches are always better for
discussion that patch-less ML posts.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (4):
  git-subtree: move from contrib/subtree/
  subtree: remove support for git version <1.7
  subtree: fix a test failure under GETTEXT_POISON
  i18n: translate the git-subtree command
