Subject: [PATCH 00/25] [CONTINUED] gettextize all C mainporcelain common commands
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This series continues where "gettextize the first 4 C mainporcelain
common commands" left off and translates all the C mainporcelain
common commands (the only non-C ones left are bisect/pull/rebase).

With this Git is up to 482 translatable messages.

For reviewing all the patches that say "basic messages" were (mostly)
converted by an automated script and should be really
straightforward. Most of these are just plain die/error/printf calls
with a single message.

See further comments on individual patches below. Most comment only
apply to the patch immediately above them.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (25):
  gettextize: git-commit basic messages
  gettextize: git-commit formatting messages

The message you get in the editor with git add . && git-commit

  gettextize: git-commit advice messages

An example of N_() and _() usage.

  gettextize: git-diff basic messages
  gettextize: git-fetch basic messages
  gettextize: git-fetch formatting messages

The status output you get on "git fetch" where it's telling you what
changed.

  gettextize: git-grep basic messages
  gettextize: git-log basic messages

This is more than just git-log actually, e.g. git-show too.

  gettextize: git-format-patch --cover-letter message

I think this should be made translatable.

  gettextize: git-merge basic messages

This need careful review. In many cases git-merge is writing out to
some .git/* file and I *don't* want to translate that, but it could
use a second set of eyes to see if I missed something.

  gettextize: git-merge "In-index merge" message
  gettextize: git-merge "Merge made by %s." message
  gettextize: git-merge remaining cmd_merge messages

These I reviewed carefully and they should be trivial.

  gettextize: git-mv basic messages
  gettextize: git-mv "bad" messages
  gettextize: git-rm basic messages

ditto, these should all be fine.

  builtin: use builtin.h in git-reset

as before, this is not needed if "builtin: use builtin.h for all
builtin/ commands" is applied. But it's here for convenience. If the
previously submitted builtin.h patch is applied this can be dropped.

  gettextize: git-reset basic messages
  gettextize: git-reset reset_type_names messages

Another N_() and _() patch.

  gettextize: git-tag basic messages
  gettextize: git-tag tag_template message

Another N_() and _() patch.

  gettextize: git-push basic messages
  builtin: use builtin.h in git-status

This is *not* in my previously submitted "builtin: use builtin.h for
all builtin/ commands" patch.

  gettextize: git-status basic messages

An old resurrected patch ...

  gettextize: git-status shortstatus messages

... but wt-status changed since then, so this was needed too.
