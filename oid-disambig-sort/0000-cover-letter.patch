Subject: [PATCH 0/9] get_short_oid UI improvements
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

I started out just wanting to do 04/09 so I'd get prettier output, but
then noticed that ^{tag}, ^{commit}< ^{blob} and ^{tree} didn't behave
as expected with the disambiguation output, and that core.disambiguate
had never been documented.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (9):
  sha1-name.c: remove stray newline
  sha1-array.h: align function arguments
  sha1-name.c: move around the collect_ambiguous() function
  get_short_oid: sort ambiguous objects by type, then SHA-1
  get_short_oid: learn to disambiguate by ^{tag}
  get_short_oid: learn to disambiguate by ^{blob}
  get_short_oid / peel_onion: ^{tree} should mean tree, not treeish
  get_short_oid / peel_onion: ^{tree} should mean commit, not commitish
  config doc: document core.disambiguate
