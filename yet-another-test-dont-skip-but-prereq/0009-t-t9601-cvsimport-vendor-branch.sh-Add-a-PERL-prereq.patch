Subject: [PATCH 09/10] t/t9601-cvsimport-vendor-branch.sh: Add a PERL prerequisite
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Change this test to declare a PERL prerequisite. These tests use the
-p switch, so they implicitly depend on Perl code, but nothing was
declaring this.
