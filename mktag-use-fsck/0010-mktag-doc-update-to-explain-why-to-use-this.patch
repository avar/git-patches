Subject: [RFC/PATCH 10/12] mktag doc: update to explain why to use this
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Change the mktag documentation to compare itself to the similar
"hash-object -t tag" command. Before this someone reading the
documentation wouldn't have much of an idea what the difference
was.

Let's make it clear that it's to do with slightly different fsck
validation logic, and cross-link the "mktag" and "hash-object"
documentation to aid discover-ability.

+The difference between the two is that mktag does the equivalent of a
