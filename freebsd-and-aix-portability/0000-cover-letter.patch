Subject: [PATCH 0/2] FreeBSD & AIX test portability fixes
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This makes the vanilla test suite pass without errors on the FreeBSD
system noted in the commit messages.

On AIX things are still horribly broken, but this fixes one more issue
that also affects that system.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (2):
  tests: fix non-portable "${var:-"str"}" construct
  tests: fix non-portable iconv invocation
