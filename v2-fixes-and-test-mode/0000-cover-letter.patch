Subject: [PATCH v2 0/8] protocol v2 fixes
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

I figured it would be easier for everyone if I rolled this all into
one series instead of Junio & us needing to keep track of what's based
on what.

The only change I made to Jeff's patches is my SOB and adding a
paragraph to the end of his 3/3 saying that the v2 push protocol
doesn't have the same issue (because it doesn't exist yet). I had that
question in this thread, and thought it was useful to clarify it.

No changes to Jonathan's one patch, except my SOB.

For the rest I incorporated Jonathan's suggestions / fixes with some
amendments. The suggestion to use env --unset isn't portable (and
there's now a check for that while we're at it), so instead we support
"GIT_TEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION=" which'll ignore the environment value.

Other changes in my patches are more narrowly skipping tests, i.e. no
"unset" anymore except for those tests where we're only doing v1 and
v2 tests. I also removed the "env" use in those cases that don't need
it (where we use e.g. test_must_fail), instead we just set the env
variable ourselves with native shell syntax.

Jeff King (3):
  serve: pass "config context" through to individual commands
  parse_hide_refs_config: handle NULL section
  upload-pack: support hidden refs with protocol v2

Jonathan Tan (1):
  builtin/fetch-pack: support protocol version 2

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (4):
  tests: add a check for unportable env --unset
  tests: add a special setup where for protocol.version
  tests: mark & fix tests broken under GIT_TEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION=1
  tests: mark tests broken under GIT_TEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION=2
