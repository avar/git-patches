Subject: [PATCH 0/6] git-cvsserver: authentication support for pserver
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This series adds optional pserver authentication support to
git-cvsserver. It's useful in legacy environments that rely on pserver
authentication support, and for various reasons can't easily switch to
ssh-based authentication.

This series was originally submitted in 2007/2008[1] and approved by
Junio[2], it stalled because I didn't follow up[3] on sending it in an
applyable format until now. Unfortunately I couldn't find a list
archive that displayed Message-ID so I couldn't respond to the
relevant messages.

Changes since the series was originally submitted:

  - There's now a test for pserver authentication support

  - Fixed the commit message of a few commits & squashed some commits.

  - It now complies with Documentation/SubmittingPatches. I.e. has
    signed-off-by lines.

  - Changed my E-Mail address in the commits.
