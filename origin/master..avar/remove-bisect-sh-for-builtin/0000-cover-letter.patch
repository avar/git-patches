Subject: [PATCH 00/13] bisect: v2.30.0 "run" regressions + make it built-in
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This fixes the regression Lukáš Doktor reported in [1], and also gets
us the full way to a builtin/bisect.c and "git rm git-bisect.sh".

Only 1-4/13 here are needed to fix the "git bisect run <cmd> [...]
--log" regression Lukáš reported, but as Jeff points out we'd still
conflate "--bisect-*" with the user arguments. That's fixed in 11/13
here.

The 1-4/13 here also fixes other but probably more minor "git bisect
run" regressions in v2.30.0, we changed the output in a few ways
without intending it. 4/13 gets us mostly back to v2.29.0 behavior,
5/13 keeps the best of it and the current output.

I think for the v2.30.0 regressions we're better off with just
something like 1-4/13 here for now, and possibly 5/13 too.

But getting to the point of fixing the root cause of "--bisect-*"
being conflated is going to take quite a bit of churn. In the
side-thread Đoàn's diffstat is on the order of 1/2 of the size of this
series, and this gives us built-in "bisect".

The 6-13 here is something I had already for a couple of days, I was
seeing if I could distill Johannes's [2] down to something much
smaller, to just make a beeline towards a built-in bisect.

Johannes's refactors the "term" passing in [3], and Đoàn ends up
needing to do much the same in [4].

Here in 9/13 I instead just extend the OPT_SUBCOMMAND() API so it's
able to accept function callbacks with custom signatures, which
eliminates the need for most of that refactoring. 11/13 then makes use
of it.
