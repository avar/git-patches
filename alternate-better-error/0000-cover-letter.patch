Subject: [PATCH 0/3] sha1-file: warn if alternate is a git repo (not object dir)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This adds a warning for the issue discussed upthread. As noted in
these patches we've been emitting an "error" while not impacting the
exit code, should we die() instead? Maybe, but until there's consensus
on that let's change this to warning() while we're at it.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (3):
  sha1-file: test the error behavior of alt_odb_usable()
  sha1-file: emit error if an alternate looks like a repository
  sha1-file: change alternate "error:" message to "warning:"
