Subject: [PATCH v3 09/10] commit-graph write: add itermediate progress
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Add progress output to sections of code between "Annotating[...]" and
"Computing[...]generation numbers". This can collectively take 5-10
seconds on a large enough repository.

On a test repository with I have with ~7 million commits and ~50
million objects we'll now emit:

    $ ~/g/git/git --exec-path=$HOME/g/git commit-graph write
    Finding commits for commit graph among packed objects: 100% (50026015/50026015), done.
    Annotating commit graph: 21567407, done.
    Counting distinct commits in commit graph: 100% (7189147/7189147), done.
    Finding extra edges in commit graph: 100% (7189147/7189147), done.
    Computing commit graph generation numbers: 100% (7144680/7144680), done.
    Writing out commit graph: 21434417, done.

Whereas on a medium-sized repository such as linux.git these new
progress bars won't have time to kick in and as before and we'll still
emit output like:

    $ ~/g/git/git --exec-path=$HOME/g/git commit-graph write
    Finding commits for commit graph among packed objects: 100% (6365492/6365492), done.
    Annotating commit graph: 2391666, done.
    Computing commit graph generation numbers: 100% (797222/797222), done.
    Writing out commit graph: 2399912, done.

The "Counting distinct commits in commit graph" phase will spend most
of its time paused at "0/*" as we QSORT(...) the list. That's not
optimal, but at least we don't seem to be stalling anymore.
