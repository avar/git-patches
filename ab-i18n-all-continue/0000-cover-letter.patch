Here's more work on top of my existing 63 patch series, bringing it to
78 patches in total.

With this all of the 'mainporcelain common' *and* 'mainporcelain' in
command-list.txt has been made translatable, aside from these
shellscripts:
    
    git-am                                  mainporcelain
    git-bisect                              mainporcelain common
    git-pull                                mainporcelain common
    git-rebase                              mainporcelain common
    git-stash                               mainporcelain
    git-submodule                           mainporcelain

Jan Krüger was doing some work on the git-add--interactive helper and
those, and I was getting comfortable with doing only C, so I've left
those for now.

This time around the changes to tests to add the NO_GETTEXT_POISON
prerequisite are part of the *.c patches themselves. This should make
it easier to review the series, since you can see what tests need to
be skipped for each patch.

This series goes on top of ab/i18n-all and can be pulled from my
GitHub branch:

    git://github.com/avar/git.git ab/i18n-all-continue
    http://github.com/avar/git/compare/ab/i18n-all...ab/i18n-all-continue
    http://github.com/avar/git/compare/ab/i18n-all...ab/i18n-all-continue.patch

And to see the whole thing from master:

    http://github.com/avar/git/compare/master...ab/i18n-all-continue
    http://github.com/avar/git/compare/master...ab/i18n-all-continue.patch

Note that this doesn't include Ramkumar Ramachandra's patch to add
Hindi. You'll have to get that from the archive separately.
