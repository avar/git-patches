Subject: [PATCH v6? 02/17] refs: remove EINVAL errno output from specification
 of read_raw_ref_fn
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This commit does not change code; it documents the fact that an alternate ref
backend does not need to return EINVAL from read_raw_ref_fn to function
properly.

This is correct, because refs_read_raw_ref is only called from;

* resolve_ref_unsafe(), which does not care for the EINVAL errno result.

* refs_verify_refname_available(), which does not inspect errno.

* files-backend.c, where errno is overwritten on failure.

* packed-backend.c (is_packed_transaction_needed), which calls it for the
  packed ref backend, which never emits EINVAL.

A grep for EINVAL */*c reveals that no code checks errno against EINVAL after
reading references. In addition, the refs.h file does not mention errno at all.

A grep over resolve_ref_unsafe() turned up the following callers that inspect
errno:

* sequencer.c::print_commit_summary, which uses it for die_errno

* lock_ref_oid_basic(), which only treats EISDIR and ENOTDIR specially.

The files ref backend does use EINVAL. The files backend does not call into
the generic API (refs_read_raw), but into the files-specific function
(files_read_raw_ref), which we are not changing in this commit.

As the errno sideband is unintuitive and error-prone, remove EINVAL
value, as a step towards getting rid of the errno sideband altogether.
