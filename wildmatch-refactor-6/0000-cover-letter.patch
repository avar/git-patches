Subject: [PATCH v4 0/7] increase wildmatch test coverage
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This fixes errors in v3 that caused failures on bash & on Windows.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (7):
  wildmatch test: indent with tabs, not spaces
  wildmatch test: use more standard shell style
  wildmatch test: don't try to vertically align our output
  wildmatch test: use a paranoia pattern from nul_match()
  wildmatch test: remove dead fnmatch() test code
  wildmatch test: perform all tests under all wildmatch() modes

No changes

  wildmatch test: create & test files on disk in addition to in-memory

Rephrase the commit message a bit.

Change $10 to ${10} for portability.

Skip tests that would create a file with "\" in the name on Windows
(or rather, where we don't have the BSLASHPSPEC prereq).
