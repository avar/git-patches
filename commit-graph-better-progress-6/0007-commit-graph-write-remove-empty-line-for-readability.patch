Subject: [PATCH v5 7/9] commit-graph write: remove empty line for readability
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Remove the empty line between a QSORT(...) and the subsequent oideq()
for-loop. This makes it clearer that the QSORT(...) is being done so
that we can run the oideq() loop on adjacent OIDs. Amends code added
in 08fd81c9b6 ("commit-graph: implement write_commit_graph()",
2018-04-02).
