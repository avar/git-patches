Subject: [PATCH 0/2] the cat-file -e option doesn't work as documented
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The -e option to cat-file will emit output, after promising not to.

We should take either 1/2 or 2/2, but not both. I'm partial to just
documenting the existing behavior and dropping 2/2, it's useful to
know if you passed in something that didn't look like a SHA-1.

But if others disagree we can drop 1/2 and take 2/2. Up to you.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (2):
  cat-file doc: document that -e will return some output
  cat-file: -e should not emit output on stderr
