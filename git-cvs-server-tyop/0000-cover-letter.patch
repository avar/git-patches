Subject: [PATCH 0/2] git-cvsserver: Minor fixes for oopsies
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The original git-cvsserver pserver support had some oops code. There
was a typo in a comment, and the error for invalid password formats
wasn't correct.

As an aside, since the original implementation I've released the code
on CPAN as the Crypt::CVS. That version also has a scramble() function
and exhaustive tests.

It would make a good experimental case for adding dual-life modules to
Git due to its smallness and the inclusion of tests.
