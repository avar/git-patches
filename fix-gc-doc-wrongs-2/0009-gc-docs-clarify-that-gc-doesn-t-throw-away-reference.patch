Subject: [PATCH v2 09/10] gc docs: clarify that "gc" doesn't throw away
 referenced objects
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Amend the "NOTES" section to fix up wording that's been with us since
3ffb58be0a ("doc/git-gc: add a note about what is collected",
2008-04-23).

I can't remember when/where anymore (I think Freenode #Git), but at
some point I was having a conversation with someone who was convinced
that "gc" would prune things only referenced by e.g. refs/pull/*, and
pointed to this section as proof.

It turned out that they'd read the "branches and tags" wording here
and thought just refs/{heads,tags}/* and refs/remotes/* etc. would be
kept, which is what we enumerate explicitly.

So let's say "other refs", even though just above we say "objects that
are referenced anywhere in your repository".

 If you are expecting some objects to be deleted and they aren't, check
 all of those locations and decide whether it makes sense in your case to
 remove those references.
