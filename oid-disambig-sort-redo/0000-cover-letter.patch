Subject: [PATCH v4 0/6] get_short_oid UI improvements
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This is like v3 except all the patches to the peel syntax & docs have
been dropped, which were controversial.

I think it's worthwhile to re-work that, but I don't have time for
that now, so I'm submitting this. Maybe I'll have time in the future
to re-work the rest, but then I can base it on top of this.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (6):
  sha1-name.c: remove stray newline
  sha1-array.h: align function arguments
  git-p4: change "commitish" typo to "committish"
  sha1-name.c: move around the collect_ambiguous() function
  get_short_oid: sort ambiguous objects by type, then SHA-1
  get_short_oid: document & warn if we ignore the type selector
