Subject: [PATCH v2 0/8] grep threading cleanup & tests
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This is the spiritual successor to the "grep: add ability to disable
threading with --threads=0 or grep.threads=0" patch I submitted as
part of my PCRE series (<20170408132506.5415-2-avarab@gmail.com>).

There's a long back & forth thread between me and Jeff King as a
follow-up to that which I'll summarize: I'd misunderstood what
--threads=1 does, because I was tracing how often a pattern was
compiled, and observing that even with --threads=1 we'd compile the
pattern twice.

This series fixes that redundant needless compilation in 3/8, skips
pthread overhead as Jeff suggested kin 3/8. The rest of the patches
are a bunch of small related fixes I noticed along the way.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (8):
  grep: assert that threading is enabled when calling grep_{lock,unlock}
  grep: add tests for --threads=N and grep.threads
  grep: don't redundantly compile throwaway patterns under threading
  grep: skip pthreads overhead when using one thread
  tests: add a PTHREADS prerequisite
  pack-object & index-pack: add test for --threads warning under
    NO_PTHREADS
  pack-objects: fix buggy warning about threads under
    NO_PTHREADS=YesPlease
  grep: given --threads with NO_PTHREADS=YesPlease, warn
