Subject: [RFC/PATCH 0/4] fsck: check for crafted timestamp git will die on
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This is not a security issue, but if it happened in certain places in
the wild it would be really annoying, as explained in 4/4. So I'd like
to give others a chance to comment on if it should go to the public
list.

I did post this on Twitter yesterday before realizing the implications
of this (I was just screwing around with fsck), but emperical evidence
suggests nobody cares about what I say on Twitter. I also (as noted in
4/4) have 2x public test repos with this sort of data on
github/gitlab.

If the wrong person knew about this and wanted to be a dick they could
submit e.g. a typo fix to some really popular git project (say Rails
or whatever), have it merged, and promtly have all its users running a
post-2.14 git hard error on "git show", "git log" etc. They'd then
need to either rewind their history, or scramble to update to a
fixed/patched version of git.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (4):
  fsck: test for MAXINT + 1, not + 2 in date oveflow test
  fsck: test for 2^63 overflowing in addition to 2^64
  fsck: refactor fsck_ident() for a follow-up change
  fsck: report near-integer overflow in ident timestamps
