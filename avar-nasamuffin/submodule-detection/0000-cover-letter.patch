Did you try running the ad-hoc benchmark I included in [1] on that
Google NFS? I've dealt with some slow-ish network filesystems, but if
it's slower than AIX's local FS (where I couldn't see a difference) I'd
put money on it being a cross-Atlantic mount or something :)

Re your:

    "this isn't a cache of some expensive operation, but rather intended to                                                                                                                          be the source of truth for all submodules."

In your 5/5 it says, in seeming contradiction to this:

    This commit may be more of an RFC - to demonstrate what life looks like
    if we use submodule.superprojectGitDir as the source of truth. But since
    'git rev-parse --show-superproject-working-tree' is used in a lot of
    scripts in the wild[1], I'm not so sure it's a great example.

    To be honest, I'd prefer to die("Try running 'git submodule update'")
    here, but I don't think that's very script-friendly. However, falling
    back on the old implementation kind of undermines the idea of treating
    submodule.superprojectGitDir as the point of truth.

Most of what I've been suggesting in my [1] and related is that I'm
confused about if & how this is a pure caching mechanism.

Removing mentions of it being a cache but it seemingly still being a
cache at the tip of this series has just added to that confusion for
me :)

Anyway. While I do think this caching mechanism is probably
unnecessary in the short to medium term, i.e. it seems to the extent
that it was ever needed was due to some bridging of *.sh<->*.c that
we're *this* close to eliminating anyway.

But maybe I'm wrong. The benchmark I suggested above on that Google
NFS might be indicative. I don't really see how something that'll be
doing a bunch of FS ops anyway is going to be noticeably slower with
that approach, but maybe opening the index/tree of the superproject is
more expensive than I'm expecting.

In any case, all of that's not the hill I'm picking to die on. If
you'd like to go ahead with this cache-or-not-a-cache then sure, I
won't belabor that point.

I *do* strongly think if we're doing so though that we should have
something like this on top. I.e. let's test wha happens if we do and
don't have this "caching" variable, which is demonstrably easy to do.

Benchmarking the two gives me:

    $ git hyperfine -L rev HEAD~0 -L s true,false -s 'make -j8 all' '(cd t && GIT_TEST_SUBMODULE_CACHE_SUPERPROJECT_DIR={s} ./t7412-submodule-absorbgitdirs.sh)'
    Benchmark 1: (cd t && GIT_TEST_SUBMODULE_CACHE_SUPERPROJECT_DIR=true ./t7412-submodule-absorbgitdirs.sh)' in 'HEAD~0
      Time (mean ± σ):     545.9 ms ±   1.6 ms    [User: 490.3 ms, System: 114.0 ms]
      Range (min … max):   543.5 ms … 548.1 ms    10 runs
     
    Benchmark 2: (cd t && GIT_TEST_SUBMODULE_CACHE_SUPERPROJECT_DIR=false ./t7412-submodule-absorbgitdirs.sh)' in 'HEAD~0
      Time (mean ± σ):     537.9 ms ±  11.4 ms    [User: 476.8 ms, System: 117.6 ms]
      Range (min … max):   532.7 ms … 570.1 ms    10 runs
     
    Summary
      '(cd t && GIT_TEST_SUBMODULE_CACHE_SUPERPROJECT_DIR=false ./t7412-submodule-absorbgitdirs.sh)' in 'HEAD~0' ran
        1.01 ± 0.02 times faster than '(cd t && GIT_TEST_SUBMODULE_CACHE_SUPERPROJECT_DIR=true ./t7412-submodule-absorbgitdirs.sh)' in 'HEAD~0'

I.e. not using the cache is either indistinguishable or a bit faster
(the "a bit faster" is definitely due to just running less test code
though).
