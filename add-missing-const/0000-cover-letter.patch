Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Add missing const to char* declarations
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

These two patches by Jonathan Nieder have been extracted from my
soon-to-be-sent updated gettext series, which he's graciously helped
with.

Without these changes this code using the new _() function will warn
because it's expecting char* but it's returning const char*. Since
there's no reason for these not to be const just add a const to the
declaration.
