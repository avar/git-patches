Subject: [RFC/PATCH 0/7] grep: move from kwset to optional PCRE v2
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This speeds things up a lot, but as shown in the patches & tests
changed modifies the behavior where we have \0 in *patterns* (only
possible with 'grep -f <file>').

I'd like to go down this route because it makes dropping kwset a lot
easier, and I don't think bending over backwards to support these \0
patterns is worth it.

But maybe others disagree, so I wanted to send what I had before I
tried tackling the pickaxe code. There I figured I'd just make -G's
ERE be a PCRE if we had the PCRE v2 backend, since unlike "grep"'s
default BRE the ERE syntax is mostly a subset of PCRE, but again
others might thing that's too aggressive and would prefer to keep the
distinction, only using PCRE there in place of our current use of
kwset.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (7):
  grep: inline the return value of a function call used only once
  grep tests: move "grep binary" alongside the rest
  grep tests: move binary pattern tests into their own file
  grep: make the behavior for \0 in patterns sane
  grep: drop support for \0 in --fixed-strings <pattern>
  grep: remove the kwset optimization
  grep: use PCRE v2 for optimized fixed-string search
