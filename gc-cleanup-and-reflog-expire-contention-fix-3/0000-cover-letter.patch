    -    this check should be changed to consider all files in objects/17/

         But none of that is something we need to worry about now, and
         supporting both 38 and 62 characters depending on "the_hash_algo"
         removes another case of SHA-1 hardcoding.
     
    +    As noted in [1] I'm making no effort to somehow remove the hardcoding
    +    for "2" as in "use the first two hexdigits for the directory
    +    name". There's no indication that that'll ever change, and somehow
    +    generalizing it here would be a drop in the ocean, so there's no point
    +    in doing that. It also couldn't be done without coming up with some
