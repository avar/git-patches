Subject: [PATCH 0/2] send-email: impose a delay while sending to appease GMail
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

GMail doesn't sort E-Mail by the "Date" header, but by when the E-Mail
was received. As a result patches sent to the git ML and LKML (and
friends) show up out of order in GMail.

This series works around that issue by sleeping for 1 second between
sending E-Mails.

If you're on the LKML and wondering why you got this, I figured
feedback from the other big user (that I know of) of send-email would
be helpful.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (2):
  send-email: add an option to impose delay sent E-Mails
  send-email: supply a --send-delay=1 by default
