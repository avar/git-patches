Subject: [PATCH v2 0/8] grep: PCRE JIT fixes + ab/no-kwset fix
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

1-3 here are a re-roll on "next". I figured that was easier for
everyone with the state of the in-flight patches, it certainly was for
me. Sorry Junio if this creates a mess for you.

4-8 are a "fix" for the UTF-8 matching error noted in Carlo's "grep:
skip UTF8 checks explicitally" in
https://public-inbox.org/git/20190721183115.14985-1-carenas@gmail.com/

As noted the bug isn't fully fixed until 8/8, and that patch relies on
unreleased PCRE v2 code. I'm hoping that with 7/8 we're in a good
enough state to limp forward as noted in the rationale of those
commits.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (8):
  grep: remove overly paranoid BUG(...) code
  grep: stop "using" a custom JIT stack with PCRE v2
  grep: stop using a custom JIT stack with PCRE v1
  grep: consistently use "p->fixed" in compile_regexp()
  grep: create a "is_fixed" member in "grep_pat"
  grep: stess test PCRE v2 on invalid UTF-8 data
  grep: do not enter PCRE2_UTF mode on fixed matching
  grep: optimistically use PCRE2_MATCH_INVALID_UTF
