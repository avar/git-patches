Subject: [PATCH 00/20] [CONTINUE] Add gettext support to Git
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This series continues work where the already pulled ab/i18n series
(now merged to pu) left off.

It can also be pulled from:

    git://github.com/avar/git.git ab/i18n-continue
    http://github.com/avar/git/compare/ab/i18n-in-git-2010-09-07...ab/i18n-continue
    http://github.com/avar/git/compare/ab/i18n-in-git-2010-09-07...ab/i18n-continue.patch

It includes the first translation of a mainporcelain command written
in shellscript (git-am). Comments on invividual patches below.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (20):
  gettextize: git-clean clean.requireForce braces
  gettextize: git-clone "Cloning into" message braces

Under GCC this warns under -Wall and will presumably break Junio's
-Werror build. I didn't notice because I use clang which (IMO rightly)
doesn't complain about this.

  po/de.po: make the German translation msgfmt --check clean

We'll see what ze Germans come up with translation wise, but meanwhile
this un-breaks the translation already in ab/i18n.

  Makefile: add GNU_GETTEXT, set when we expect GNU gettext
  Makefile: MSGFMT="msgfmt --check" under GNU_GETTEXT

And these two patches make sure that a translation will never break
like that again. Since msgfmt --check is a GNU-ism I needed to add
support for GNU_GETTEXT=YesPlease in the Makefile.

Maybe a check for this could be added to the configure.ac script, but
I couldn't find a way to do so, and for the reasons explained in the
patches I don't think it was worth my time.

  Revert "gettextize: git-revert mark the "me" variable for
    translation"

Revert this as discussion on-list. Alternatively the "gettextize:
git-revert mark the "me" variable for translation" patch could be
ejected from the existing ab/i18n series.

  gettextize: git-revert "Your local changes" message
  gettextize: git-revert literal "me" messages

Do The Right Thing when translating the "me" messsages.

  gettext: add GETTEXT_POISON support for shell scripts
  gettext: add GETTEXT_POISON tests for shell scripts

We need poison for .sh too to ensure sanity.

  gettextize: git-am add git-sh-i18n
  gettextize: git-am one-line gettext $msg; echo
  gettextize: git-am multi-line getttext $msg; echo
  gettextize: git-am eval_gettext messages
  gettextize: git-am die messages
  gettextize: git-am cannot_fallback messages

Note: Isn't --check clean because the existing code indented with
spaces.

  gettextize: git-am clean_abort messages
  gettextize: git-am "Apply?" message
  gettextize: git-am core say messages
  gettextize: git-am printf(1) message to eval_gettext

All these git-am patches are split up like this to make it easier to
review them, and to demonstrate the different sort of messages we'll
have to translate in the shell scripts.

I won't sent commits quite so granular in the future (unless
requested).
