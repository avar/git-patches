Subject: [PATCH v2 0/3] index-pack: test updates

I'd still probalby like to have core.checkCollisions as a config knob
to be able to turn it off, but let's see what Jeff comes up with once
he finishes his WIP cache patch.

In the meantime 1-3/4 of my series is obviously correct test fixes
which I'd like queued up first.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (3):
  pack-objects test: modernize style
  pack-objects tests: don't leave test .git corrupt at end
  index-pack tests: don't leave test repo dirty at end
