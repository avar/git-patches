Subject: [PATCH v2 3/6] commit-graph write: show progress for object search
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Show the percentage progress for the "Finding commits for commit
graph" phase for the common case where we're operating on all packs in
the repository, as "commit-graph write" or "gc" will do.

Before we'd emit on e.g. linux.git with "commit-graph write":

    Finding commits for commit graph: 6365492, done.
    [...]

And now:

    Finding commits for commit graph: 100% (6365492/6365492), done.
    [...]

Since the commit graph only includes those commits that are packed
(via for_each_packed_object(...)) the approximate_object_count()
returns the actual number of objects we're going to process.

Still, it is possible due to a race with "gc" or another process
maintaining packs that the number of objects we're going to process is
lower than what approximate_object_count() reported. In that case we
don't want to stop the progress bar short of 100%. So let's make sure
it snaps to 100% at the end.

The inverse case is also possible and more likely. I.e. that a new
pack has been added between approximate_object_count() and
for_each_packed_object(). In that case the percentage will go beyond
100%, and we'll do nothing to snap it back to 100% at the end.
