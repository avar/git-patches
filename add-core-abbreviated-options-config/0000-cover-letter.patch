Subject: [PATCH 0/2] allow for configuring option abbreviation + fix
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

This is based on Johannes's just-submitted
https://public-inbox.org/git/pull.167.git.gitgitgadget@gmail.com/

Some of this in my 1/2 could obviously be shortened if the
"GIT_TEST_ABBREVIATED_OPTIONS" name was used by default, but I'll
leave it up to discussion whether it's worth it to go for the route I
took here, and if so to rebase the whole thing or not.

While I'm at it fix a bug I noticed a while ago in 2/2 related to the
option abbreviation being silly and tripping over itself over an
aliased option.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (2):
  parse-options: allow for configuring option abbreviation
  parse-options: don't emit "ambiguous option" for aliases
