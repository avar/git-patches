Yeah, but I'm leaving this for the future. I doubt that it's going to
happen in practice, although if you have a huge skip-list...

I think this whole notion of reading the same config from two places
sucks, and now with my patches it's three. But I can't think of a
reasonable way to make it better without even more complexity, and
maybe it's better to split it up anyway, i.e. the stuff you want to
accept is different that fsck and fetch.

Sorry, too late. I already wrote all of this :)

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (4):
  config doc: don't describe *.fetchObjects twice
  config doc: unify the description of fsck.* and receive.fsck.*
  config doc: elaborate on what transfer.fsckObjects does
  fetch: implement fetch.fsck.*
