Subject: [PATCH v5 0/9] git fetch" should not clobber existing tags without --force
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Addresses Junio's comments to v4, and I had a few fixes of my own. I
don't know if this range-diff is more or less readble than just
re-reading it, but here goes:

    -    In [1] this was pointed out to me, but in submitting [2] the patches I

    -    re-pushing annotated tags", 2018-07-31).
    -
    -    Let's just remove the quotes, and use a string that doesn't need to be
    -    quoted (-mtag.message is a bit less confusing than -mmsg). I could try
    -    to chase after getting the quoting right here with multiple
    -    backslashes, but I don't think it's worth it, and it makes things much
    -    less readable.
