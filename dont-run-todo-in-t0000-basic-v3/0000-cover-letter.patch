Subject: [PATCH v3 0/4] Support for running tests outside t/ + don't run a TODO test
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This *really* v3, I just sent another copy of v2 unchanged
accidentally (this is really not my day). This one:

 * Fixes a trivial shell syntax error in the last patch (oops!)

 * Uses #!$SHELL_PATH for a shebang instead of #!/bin/sh in the file
   we're about to write out. This now passes e.g. on Solaris which has
   an insane /bin/sh.

As an aside there's a bunch of other things in our tests that are
writing out shellscripts with a #!/bin/sh shebang instead of
#!$SHELL_PATH. These are passing purely by accident since they just
happen to use shell syntax that doesn't run afoul of grumpy old shells
like Solaris's /bin/sh.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (4):
  test-lib: Use $TEST_DIRECTORY or $GIT_BUILD_DIR instead of $(pwd) and
    ../
  test-lib: Use "$GIT_BUILD_DIR" instead of "$TEST_DIRECTORY"/../
  test-lib: Allow overriding of TEST_DIRECTORY
  t/t0000-basic.sh: Run the passing TODO test inside its own test-lib
