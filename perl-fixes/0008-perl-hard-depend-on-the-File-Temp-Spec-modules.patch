Subject: [PATCH 8/8] perl: hard-depend on the File::{Temp,Spec} modules
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Since my d48b284183 ("perl: bump the required Perl version to 5.8 from
5.6.[21]", 2010-09-24), we've depended on 5.8, so there's no reason to
conditionally require File::Temp and File::Spec anymore. They were
first released with perl versions v5.6.1 and 5.00405, respectively.

This code was originally added in c14c8ceb13 ("Git.pm: Make File::Spec
and File::Temp requirement lazy", 2008-08-15), presumably to make
Git.pm work on 5.6.0.
