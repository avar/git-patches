Subject: [PATCH 0/2] doc hash-function-transition: minor & major clarifications
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Having read through the hash-function-transition.txt again, a couple
of things jumped out at me:

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (2):
  doc hash-function-transition: clarify how older gits die on NewHash

We weren't accurately describing how "git status" would die on NewHash
repos on new versions.

  doc hash-function-transition: clarify what SHAttered means

I don't think we had a good summary of how SHA-1 vulnerabilities
overlap with concerns Git has, now that we've moved to the hardened
SHA-1.

I may very well have gotten this new summary subtly wrong though. So
please review.
