Subject: [PATCH 0/3] progress.c API users: fix bogus counting
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

As a split-off from the larger topic these were submitted as part of
[1] and which didn't get picked up. As I pointed out in [2] that
larger topic had some hidden untested-for flaws.

But these patches are just fixes to bogus progress bar output from
that topic. Let's consider them in isolation...
