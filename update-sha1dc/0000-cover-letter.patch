Since that patch is now in Marc's upstream code we can just update to
that.

While we're at it let's see if Marc will take a patch so that we can
use his code as-is with some Makefile trickery of our own, instead of
having to solve merge conflicts each time we update from him. I'll
submit a pull request for that shortly.

And since if and when that pull request gets accepted we're at the
point of being able to use the upstream code as-is & don't need to
locally modify it, we can just use a submodule to track it.

  sha1dc: update from my fork of upstream
  sha1dc: use sha1collisiondetection as a submodule
  sha1dc: remove our old copy of the sha1dc code
