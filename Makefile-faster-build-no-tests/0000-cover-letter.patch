Subject: [PATCH 0/4] Makefile: micro-optimize light non-test builds
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This small series speeds up builds where you just want to get to a
working "git" binary, but don't care about running git's own tests, or
about making/installing fallbacks for "git svn" et al (which we do
even with NO_PERL).

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (4):
  Makefile: refactor assignment for subsequent change
  Makefile: refactor for subsequent change
  Makefile: add a NO_TEST_TOOLS flag
  Makefile: add a NO_{INSTALL_,}SCRIPT_FALLBACKS target
