Yeah this has never worked and GIT_TEST_INSTALLED has been documented
to take an absolute path when used with the normal test suite.

I've noted as much in the 1/2 here.

Yeah, v1 didn't because I was trying for a minimal regression fix
without digging us fully out of that GIT_TEST_INSTALLED hole, but as
2/2 here shows we can fully get rid of it from perf-lib.sh, which I
think makes things much simpler.

It seems simplest after the changes I've made here to just make a
relative GIT_TEST_INSTALLED be an error in test-lib.sh, why bend over
backwards to support it?

Re GIT_PERF_RESULTS_PREFIX: Depending on what you mean we now have
that in 2/2 as PERF_RESULTS_PREFIX.

But if you mean the user can pass it in that doesn't make sense, since
we need to pick a different prefix revision we test, so it's a
many-to-many relationship.

As seen in 2/2 modifying some of the shell & associated Perl code it's
a bit nasty that we need to duplicate the logic for picking these
PERF_RESULTS_PREFIXes in the shell code and Perl code. Ideally the
shell code would pick it, and pass the mapping to the Perl code
somehow. But that's another "has sucked since forever, future TODO"
item.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (2):
  perf-lib.sh: make "./run <revisions>" use the correct gits
  perf-lib.sh: remove GIT_TEST_INSTALLED from perf-lib.sh
