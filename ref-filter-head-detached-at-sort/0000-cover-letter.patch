Subject: [PATCH 0/5] branch: --sort improvements
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This started out as a reading of ref-filter.c where I wondered why we
needed this i18n lego. I'm not sure whether in Chinese what Matthew
DeVore said in [1] is true, but in any case it seems better to leave
that to the translators, re-using the string is a relatively small
gain.

So I think that change was really just "ASCII sort is easier than
checking a flag in a sort callback", fair enough. But I thought I'd
try to see how hard that patch would be. Turned out it's rather easy &
I think results in better code, 4/5 gets us to that point.

But 5/5 I think makes this more generally interesting. In all locales
(including LC_ALL=C) we list the "HEAD detached" entry last in "git
branch -l" output if you're doing a reverse sort. I don't think this
makes any sense, it's a notice, not a refname to be sorted. Using the
new sorting function for treating detached HEAD specially makes this
trivial to fix.
