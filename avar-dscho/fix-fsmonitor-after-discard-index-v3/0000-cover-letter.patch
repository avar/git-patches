Subject: [PATCH v3 0/2] Fix fsmonitor after discard_index()
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This v3 is all Johannes's patches. The outstanding review on v2 could
be clarified with a commit message change, which I've addressed, and
v2 conflicted with a cache.h change that's since landed in "master",
which I've rebased this on.

Junio: We're getting closer to the release so it would be great to
have this. It's been broken for a long time, but having this finaly
fixed in v2.22 would be great. The functional code changes are also
isolated to the fsmonitor code path, which reduces the risk and makes
this easier to review/reason about.

Johannes Schindelin (2):
  fsmonitor: demonstrate that it is not refreshed after discard_index()
  fsmonitor: force a refresh after the index was discarded
