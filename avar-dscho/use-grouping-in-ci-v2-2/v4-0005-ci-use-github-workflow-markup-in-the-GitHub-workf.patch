Subject: [RFC PATCH v4 5/6] ci: use `--github-workflow-markup` in the GitHub
 workflow
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

[Ævar: due to re-structuring on top of my series the {begin,end}_group
in CI isn't needed at all to get "group" output for the test
suite. This commit includes the now-squashed "ci/run-build-and-tests:
add some structure to the GitHub workflow output":]

The current output of Git's GitHub workflow can be quite confusing,
especially for contributors new to the project.

To make it more helpful, let's introduce some collapsible grouping.
Initially, readers will see the high-level view of what actually
happened (did the build fail, or the test suite?). To drill down, the
respective group can be expanded.

Note: sadly, workflow output currently cannot contain any nested groups
(see https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/802 for details),
therefore we take pains to ensure to end any previous group before
starting a new one.

[Ævar: The above comment isn't true anymore, as that limitation has
been removed by basing this on my patches to run "make" and "make
test" directly from the top-level of main.yml.

Those are now effectively their own "group", effectively giving this
stage another group "level" to use. This means that the equivalent of
"make test" won't be on the same level as an individual test failure.

We no longer take any pains to ensure balanced group output as a
result (which was a caveat the previous ci/lib.sh implementation had
to deal with., We just need to "cat" the generated *.markup]
