Subject: [PATCH 0/5] pretty format %(trailers): improve machine readability
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

I started writing this on top of "master", but then saw the
outstanding series of other miscellaneous fixes to this
facility[1]. This is on top of that topic & rebased on master.

Anders, any plans to re-roll yours? Otherwise the conflicts I'd have
on mine are easy to fix, so I can also submit it as a stand-alone.

This series comes out of a discussion at work today (well, yesterday
at this point) where someone wanted to parse %(trailers) output. As
noted in 3/5 doing this is rather tedious now if you're trying to
unambiguously grap trailers as a stream of key-value pairs.

So this series adds a "key_value_separator" and "keyonly" parameters,
and fixes a few bugs I saw along the way.
