Subject: [PATCH v3 6/7] fetch tests: correct a comment "remove it" -> "remove
 them"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Correct a comment referring to the removal of just the branch to also
refer to the tag. This should have been changed in my
ca3065e7e7 ("fetch tests: add a tag to be deleted to the pruning
tests", 2018-02-09) when the tag deletion was added, but I missed it
at the time.
