Fair enough. I just wanted to make sure it had been seen. It wasn't
obvious whether it had just been missed since there was no follow-up
there or note in WC.

We were disagreeing to the extent that some of this should be
documented in 878tcbmbqb.fsf@evledraar.gmail.com and related, and I
see you've ejected the doc patch I had in that series.

I really think we should be saying something like what this new doc
series says, it's conceptually on top of Duy's series but applies on
top of master.

I think there's room to quibble about whether to include 1/2 at all
since it's a relatively obscure edge case.

2/2 however is something I think a *lot* of users are going to hit. I
just skimmed the relevant bits of git-config and git-update-index now,
and nothing describes the UC as an experimental feature, and it's been
well-known to improve performance.

When users upgrade to 2.17 they're going to have git yelling at them
(as my users did) on existing checkouts, with no indication whatsoever
that it's due to the UC or how to fix it.

Let's at least documente it. I also wonder if the "dir.c: stop
ignoring opendir() error in open_cached_dir()" change shouldn't have
something in the warning itself about it being caused by the UC,
doesn't it only warn under that mode? I.e.:

    -"could not open directory '%s'")
    +"core.untrackedCache: could not open directory '%s'")

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (2):
  update-index doc: note a fixed bug in the untracked cache
  update-index doc: note the caveat with "could not open..."
