Subject: [PATCH v2 00/12] get_short_oid UI improvements
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

A v2 addressing feedback so far. Comments inline per-patch.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (12):
  sha1-name.c: remove stray newline
  sha1-array.h: align function arguments

No changes.

  git-p4: change "commitish" typo to "committish"

New, I fixed my own "commitish" elsewhere, fixing it here in this
unrelated area while I'm at it.

  cache.h: add comment explaining the order in object_type

New: Derrick Stolee pointed out why the object type enum used later is
ordered that way, explain that with a comment.

  sha1-name.c: move around the collect_ambiguous() function

Trivial grammar correction in commit message:
    -    collect_ambiguous() function is now, which would result in a
    +    collect_ambiguous() function is now. Without this we'd then have a

  get_short_oid: sort ambiguous objects by type, then SHA-1

* Grammar fixes in commit message
* Add docs to api-oid-array.txt documenting the new oid_array_for_each()
* Document in the commit message why we sort twice
* Note inline in sha1-array.c why oid_array_for_each() doesn't sort
  with a pointer to the API docs.
* Add test to assert that we sort objects in the order we expect, and
  that they're hash sorted within the object types.

  get_short_oid: learn to disambiguate by ^{tag}
  get_short_oid: learn to disambiguate by ^{blob}

No changes.

  get_short_oid / peel_onion: ^{tree} should be tree, not treeish

s/mean/be/ in subject line (to avoid wrapping in E-Mail).

  get_short_oid / peel_onion: ^{commit} should be commit, not committish

Rewrite commit message, now assumes less context from the rest of the
series & is easier to read stand-alone.

  config doc: document core.disambiguate

Change commitish to committish, and note the `$sha1:` peel syntax.

  get_short_oid: document & warn if we ignore the type selector

New: Explain why we ignore e.g. $sha1^{blob} if there's no blobs with
the $sha1 prefix.
