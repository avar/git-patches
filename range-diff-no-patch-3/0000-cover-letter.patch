Subject: [PATCH v3 0/2] range-diff: doc + regression fix
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

As Johannes notes this --no-patch option I wanted to add is something
we had already, but is it turns out it was broken.

So this is an entirely rewritten v3 (not bothering with the range-diff
for it) which a) documents the output stability of stuff like --stat
and the like (there isn't any) b) fixes the regression & adds a test.

I did try various other diff options and they all seem to work.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (2):
  range-diff doc: add a section about output stability
  range-diff: fix regression in passing along diff options
