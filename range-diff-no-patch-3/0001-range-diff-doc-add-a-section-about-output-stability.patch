Subject: [PATCH v3 1/2] range-diff doc: add a section about output stability
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The range-diff command is already advertised as porcelain, but let's
make it really clear that the output is completely subject to change,
particularly when it comes to diff options such as --stat. Right now
that option doesn't work, but fixing that is the subject of a later
change.

+OUTPUT STABILITY
+----------------
+
+The output of the `range-diff` command is subject to change. It is
+intended to be human-readable porcelain output, not something that can
+be used across versions of Git to get a textually stable `range-diff`
+(as opposed to something like the `--stable` option to
+linkgit:git-patch-id[1]). There's also no equivalent of
+linkgit:git-apply[1] for `range-diff`, the output is not intended to
+be machine-readable.
+
+This is particularly true when passing in diff options. Currently some
+options like `--stat` can as an emergent effect produce output that's
+quite useless in the context of `range-diff`. Future versions of
+`range-diff` may learn to interpret such options in a manner specifc
+to `range-diff` (e.g. for `--stat` summarizing how the diffstat
+changed).
