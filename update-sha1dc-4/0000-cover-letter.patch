Makes sense to take it slow. Hopefully this addresses your comments. I
dropped the 3rd patch to remove sha1dc/ and the 2nd patch adds
sha1collisiondetection/ as submodule, but it's not used unless you
specify DC_SHA1_SUBMODULE in addition to DC_SHA1.

Both patches should be safe to include & not cause any disruption, but
now those interested in making the submodule experience in git.git
better can init/update & set DC_SHA1_SUBMODULE=Y to play with it.

Note that both patches update to a newer version of the upstream
code. I sent them another pull request with some cleanups, one of
which is to ignore .depends in their .gitignore file.

I liked the suggestion to make the URL a relative path, but this would
require you to maintain a mirror in the same places you push git.git
to, is that something you'd be willing to do?

For now having no-mirror isn't a big issue with my new 2/2 since it'se
something you have to opt-in to with a build flag, which I suspect
only I/Brandon/Stefan & a few others will use.
