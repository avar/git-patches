Subject: [PATCH 035/160] gettextize: git-branch "remote branch '%s' not found" message
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This could be done better by splitting it up, but it would change too
much code, which I'm trying to avoid at this point. Instead add a
TRANSLATORS comment to explain what "remote " does.
