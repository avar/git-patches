Subject: [PATCH 0/3] remote-mediawiki: fix RCE issue
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

So, I said I'd fix this, and here we are more than a week later for
something I thought would take me at most an hour or two.

The reason it took so long (maybe 1-2 days, had other backburner
things) is because the test suite for remote-mediawiki was a giant
dumsterfire. Just getting it to the point where I could run its tests
took ages.

I've sent those 15 patches to the public list since they don't in any
way hint that there's a security issue, just a bunch of changes needed
to fixup the test code.

These 3 patches can go on top of that, or can just be applied
stand-alone, you just won't be able to test them easily without the
other 15. They fix the reported RCE.

Per what I said upthread I don't know how serious this issue should be
considered vis-a-vis making point releases, I'll leave that to
others. But I wanted to leave the door open to doing such a release
with either the 15+3 patches, or just these 3.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (3):
  remote-mediawiki: provide a list form of run_git()
  remote-mediawiki: convert to quoted run_git() invocation
  remote-mediawiki: annotate unquoted uses of run_git()
