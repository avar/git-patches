Subject: [PATCH v2 00/18] remote-mediawiki: fix RCE issue, and the tests
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This series now has a fix for a remote code execution which previously
was only being discussed on the closed git-security list. Per
discussion there the issue is being made public.

Basically, we expect that almost nobody is using this code in the
first place so there wasn't any interest in a point release, and there
wasn't any downstream interest in an embargo either.

This v2 addresses (hopefully) all the public & git-security commends
on the v1s of this series.

    +    remote-mediawiki doc: don't hardcode Debian PHP versions
     
    -    Change the version in the documentation to what's currently in Debian
    -    stable. Ideally we wouldn't have to keep changing this version, but if
    -    it's going to be hardcoded let's use something that works on a modern
    -    installation.
    +    Change the hardcoded version 5 PHP versions to the version-agnostic
    +    packages. Currently Debian stable's version is 7.3, and there's a
    +    php7.3, php7.3-cli etc. package available (but no php5-*).
    +
    +    The corresponding version-less package is a dependency package which
    +    depends on whatever the current stable version is. By not hardcoding
    +    the version these instructions won't be out of date when the next
    +    Debian/Ubuntu release happens.
