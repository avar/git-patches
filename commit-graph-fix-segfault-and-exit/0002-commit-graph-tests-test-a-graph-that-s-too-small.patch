Subject: [PATCH 2/8] commit-graph tests: test a graph that's too small
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Use the recently split-up components of the corrupt_graph_and_verify()
function to assert that we error on graphs that are too small. The
error was added in 2a2e32bdc5 ("commit-graph: implement git
commit-graph read", 2018-04-10), but there was no test for it.
