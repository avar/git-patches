Subject: [PATCH v4 0/4] githooks.txt improvements + core.hooksDirectory
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

In this version of the series I've hopefully addressed all the
comments that came up on the list after the last one, and a few fixes
I noticed myself, e.g. a couple of grammar errors and a broken
asciidoc syntax.

I've combined both the githooks.txt documentation improvements and the
core.hooksDirectory patch into one series. Although they're logically
different things I think it makes more sense to combine them for ease
of reading, since the core.hooksDirectory documentation refers to some
documentation I fixed earlier in the series.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (4):
  githooks.txt: Improve the intro section
  githooks.txt: Amend dangerous advice about 'update' hook ACL
  githooks.txt: Minor improvements to the grammar & phrasing
  hooks: Add ability to specify where the hook directory is
