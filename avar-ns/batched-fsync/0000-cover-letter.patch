Subject: [RFC PATCH 0/7] bottom-up ns/batched-fsync & "plugging" in object-file.c
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

This RFC series is a continuation of the thread at
https://lore.kernel.org/git/CANQDOde2OG8fVSM1hQE3FBmzWy5FkgQCWAUYhFztB8UGFyJELg@mail.gmail.com/;
More details in individual commit messages.

I'd suggested (upthread of) there pass new object flags down to the
object machinery instead of the {un,}plug_bulk_checkin() API
route. This has advantages described in more details in individual
patches.

This also shows that the not-using tmpdir approach can be
significantly faster than using it, and per my understanding just as
safe fsync-wise for those willing to deal with the caveat of possibly
having truncated *unreachable* objects.

I thought that showing some working code with what I was suggesting
was more productive than continuing the current back & forth :)

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (7):
  write-or-die.c: remove unused fsync_component() function
  unpack-objects: add skeleton HASH_N_OBJECTS{,_{FIRST,LAST}} flags
  object-file: pass down unpack-objects.c flags for "bulk" checkin
  update-index: use a utility function for stdin consumption
  update-index: pass down an "oflags" argument
  update-index: rename "buf" to "line"
  update-index: make use of HASH_N_OBJECTS{,_{FIRST,LAST}} flags
