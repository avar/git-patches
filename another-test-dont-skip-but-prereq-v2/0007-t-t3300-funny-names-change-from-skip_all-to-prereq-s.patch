Subject: [PATCH v2 7/7] t/t3300-funny-names: change from skip_all=* to prereq skip
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Change this test to skip test with test prerequisites, and to do setup
work in tests. This improves the skipped statistics on platforms where
the test isn't run.
