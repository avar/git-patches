Subject: [PATCH 0/2] commit-graph: add progress output
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This series adds progress output to the commit-graph command, so that
when it's called by "git gc" or "git fsck" we can see what's going on
with it.

  commit-graph write: add progress output
  commit-graph verify: add progress output
