Subject: [PATCH v2 0/7] gc: minor code cleanup + contention fixes
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Addresse Peff's comments to v1. For a couple of patches I've faked up
his SOB where I copy/pasted a comment or code from a v1 comment
verbatim. Will see if he acks that.

The main change is a better commit message in the last patch (now
7/7), and 2x new "reflog" patches to make it early exit in addition to
"gc" when there's nothing to do.

There was the "why do it at all in gc" feedback on 6/7 in v1. I've
adjusted the commit message there to justify it, but we'll see what
Peff things about it this time around...

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (7):
  gc: remove redundant check for gc_auto_threshold
  gc: convert to using the_hash_algo
  gc: refactor a "call me once" pattern
  reflog tests: make use of "test_config" idiom
  reflog: exit early if there's no work to do
  gc: don't run "reflog expire" when keeping reflogs
  reflog expire: don't assert the OID when locking refs

    -    However, we may want to modify this code for the hash function
    -    transition. There's a potential pathological case here where we'll

    +    we'll only consider the loose objects for the currently active hash,
    +    but objects for that hash will share a directory storage with the
    +    other hash.
     
         Thus we could theoretically have 1k SHA-1 loose objects, and say 1
         million SHA-256 objects, and not notice because we're currently using
         SHA-1.
     
    +    So assuming that "gc" eventually learns to pack up both SHA-1 and
    +    SHA-256 objects regardless of what the current the_hash_alg is perhaps
    +    this check should be changed to consider all files in objects/17/
    +    matching [0-9a-f] 38 or 62 characters in length (i.e. both SHA-1 and
    +    SHA-256).
    +
    +    But none of that is something we need to worry about now, and
    +    supporting both 38 and 62 characters depending on "the_hash_algo"
    +    removes another case of SHA-1 hardcoding.

         reflog expire: don't assert the OID when locking refs
     
    -    The locking protocol for reflogs involves getting a *.lock file on the
    -    loose ref[1] (even if the actual ref is packed). This isn't needed to
    -    expire the reflog, and needlessly results promotes reference update
    -    contention to hard errors in e.g. "gc".
    -
         During reflog expiry, the cmd_reflog_expire() function first iterates
    -    over all known references, and then one-by-one acquires the lock for
    -    each one to expire its reflog. By the time it gets around to
    -    re-visiting the references some of the OIDs may have changed.

    +    each one to expire its reflog by getting a *.lock file on the
    +    corresponding loose ref[1] (even if the actual ref is packed).
    +
    +    This lock is needed, but what isn't needed is locking the loose ref as
    +    a function of the OID we found from that first iteration. By the time
    +    we get around to re-visiting the reference some of the OIDs may have
    +    changed.
     
    -    This has been the case ever since "reflog expire" was initially
    -    implemented in 4264dc15e1 ("git reflog expire", 2006-12-19). As seen
    -    in that simpler initial version of the code (and the same is the case
    -    before this change) we subsequently use the OID to inform the expiry,
    -    but never needed to use it to lock the reference associated with the
    -    reflog.
    +    Thus the verify_lock() function called by the lock_ref_oid_basic()
    +    function being changed here would fail with e.g. "ref '%s' is at %s
    +    but expected %s" if the repository was being updated concurrent to the
    +    "reflog expire".

    +    By not passing the OID to it we'll try to lock the reference
    +    regardless of it last known OID. Locking as a function of the OID
    +    would make "reflog expire" exit with a non-zero exit status under such
    +    contention, which in turn meant that a "gc" command (which expires
    +    reflogs before forking to the background) would encounter a hard
    +    error.

    -    If we instead lock the reference without considering what OID we last
    -    saw it at, we won't encounter user-visible contention to the extent
    -    that core.filesRefLockTimeout mitigates it. See 4ff0f01cb7 ("refs:
    -    retry acquiring reference locks for 100ms", 2017-08-21).
