Subject: [PATCH v2 0/6] bisect: follow-up fixes from js/bisect-in-c
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

A trivial update to this topic of follow-up fixes to "bisect", which
is now a built-in. See
https://lore.kernel.org/git/cover-0.6-00000000000-20221215T094038Z-avarab@gmail.com/
for the v1 & general summary.

Change since v1:

 * Rephrased & updated a commit message which was outdated as of
   f37d0bdd42d, see the range-diff. Thanks to Đoàn Trần Công Danh for
   spotting it.

Johannes Schindelin (5):
  bisect--helper: simplify exit code computation
  bisect: verify that a bogus option won't try to start a bisection
  bisect run: fix the error message
  bisect: remove Cogito-related code
  bisect: no longer try to clean up left-over `.git/head-name` files

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (1):
  bisect--helper: make the order consistently `argc, argv`

         However, the error message was supposed to print out whether the state
         was "good" or "bad", but used a bogus (because non-populated) `args`
    -    variable for it. This was fixed in 80c2e9657f2 (bisect--helper: report
    -    actual bisect_state() argument on error, 2022-01-18), but the error
    -    message still talks about `bisect--helper`, which is an implementation
