This patch series implements that simpler way of digging ourselves out
of the immediate hole that we're clobbering tags by default without
the --force option.

I'm not 100% happy about this, but I think sans stuff that comes up in
review it's in principle ready for inclusion, stuff I wished I'd done
but have left for later:

 * Write a gitrefspec(5) man page, now we have how they work, and how
   they work on push/pull scattered over two docs, which before this
   are in conflict with one another.

 * Have much more exhaustive tests, I started trying to integrate this
   with the much more exhaustive tag pruning tests in my
   https://github.com/avar/git/tree/refspec-support-+-in-tags but gave
   up because the various interaction with those tests is messy,
   e.g. if we fail a tag update we don't prune as the existing tests
   assert, because the whole ref transaction fails.

 * 05/08 notes how the semantics of whether something needs a --force
   are really confusing because the rules are different depending on
   the ref namespace you're pushing into. We should probably build on
   top of this and e.g. refuse to clobber tags outside of refs/tags/*.

 * Should we do better to mitigate this breaking stuff for existing
   users who really are expecting their tags to be clobbered? Maybe by
   adding a --force-tags option (which wouldn't clobber branches), or
   have some config option either enable the old behavior, or make
   this opt-in?
