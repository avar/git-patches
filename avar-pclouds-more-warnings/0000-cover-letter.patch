Subject: [PATCH v4 0/4] Make DEVELOPER more more flexible with DEVOPTS
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This is a v4 and replacement of gitster/nd/warn-more-for-devs. I'm
sending this with Duy's blessing.

The first two patches are the same, except for one trivial
s/faimily/family/ typo fix.

The third patch in gitster/nd/warn-more-for-devs ("Makefile: add
EAGER_DEVELOPER mode") is gone, instead there's now a DEVOPTS
option. The 3/4 and 4/4 add a way to turn off -Werror & the -Wextra
suppression, respectively.

Duy was right in [1] that this is a much better and extensible way of
doing this than my "Makefile: untangle DEVELOPER and -Werror" patch.

Most of 3/4 & 4/4 are just tweaked from git@github.com:pclouds/git.git
pclouds/more-warnings and combined with my previous 4/3 patch[2].

I changed the "no-suppression" name in Duy's WIP patch to "extra-all",
and "gentle" to "no-error". I think those are cleare,r and leave
things more open to future expansion, e.g. if we'd like pedantic-all.
