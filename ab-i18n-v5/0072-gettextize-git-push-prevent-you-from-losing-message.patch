Subject: [PATCH 072/161] gettextize: git-push "prevent you from losing" message
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Gettextize the "To prevent you from losing history" message. A test in
lib-httpd.sh and another in t5541-http-push.sh explicitly checked for
this message. Change them to skip under GETTEXT_POISON=YesPlease.
