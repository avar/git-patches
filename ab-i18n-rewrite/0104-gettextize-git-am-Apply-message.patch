Subject: [PATCH 104/160] gettextize: git-am "Apply?" message
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Make the "Apply? [y]es/[n]o/[e]dit/[v]iew patch/[a]ccept all" message
translatable, and leave a note in a TRANSLATORS comment explaining
that translators have to preserve a mention of the y/n/e/v/a
characters since the program will expect them, and not their
localized equivalents.
