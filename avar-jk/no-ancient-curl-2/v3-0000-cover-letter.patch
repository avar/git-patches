Subject: [PATCH v3 0/7] drop support for ancient curl, improve version checks
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This should address the feedback on v2, except that I did not update
the INSTALL document as Bagas Sanjaya suggested. We did not have
existing discussion of the generally supported minimal support minimal
version there, that would make sense as a follow-up patch.

There's minor commit message changes here, and two new patches, one is
another missed ifdef we could remove because the version comparion was
wrong, and the last commit entirely gets rid of LIBCURL_VERSION_NUM
checks in the codebase in favor of checking specific defined macros.

Jeff King (3):
  http: drop support for curl < 7.11.1
  http: drop support for curl < 7.16.0
  http: drop support for curl < 7.19.4

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (4):
  http: drop support for curl < 7.19.3 and <= 7.16.4 (or <7.17.0)
    (again)
  http: drop support for curl < 7.18.0 (again)
  http: rename CURLOPT_FILE to CURLOPT_WRITEDATA
  http: centralize the accounting of libcurl dependencies

         Drop support for this ancient version of curl and simplify the code by
         allowing us get rid of some "#ifdef"'s.
     
    -    Git will not build with vanilla curl older than 7.11.1 due to (at
    -    least) two issues:
    -
    -      - our use of CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE in 37ee680d9b
    -        (http.postbuffer: allow full range of ssize_t values,
    -        2017-04-11). This field was introduced in curl 7.11.1.
    -
    -      - our use of CURLPROTO_* outside any #ifdef in aeae4db174
    -        (http: create function to get curl allowed protocols,
    -        2016-12-14). These were introduced in curl 7.19.4.

         We could solve these compilation problems with more #ifdefs,

         and drop any existing ifdefs that go further back. One
         obvious benefit is that we'll have fewer conditional bits
         cluttering the code.

         Remove the conditional use of CURLAUTH_DIGEST_IE and
         CURLOPT_USE_SSL. These two have been split from earlier simpler checks
         against LIBCURL_VERSION_NUM for ease of review.
     
    -    The CURLAUTH_DIGEST_IE flag was added in n 7.19.3[1], and
    -    CURLOPT_USE_SSL in 7.16.4[2], as noted in [2] it was then renamed from
    -    the older CURLOPT_FTP_SSL.
