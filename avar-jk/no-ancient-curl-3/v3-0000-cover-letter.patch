         Drop support for this ancient version of curl and simplify the code by

         cluttering the code.

         Remove the conditional use of CURLAUTH_DIGEST_IE and
         CURLOPT_USE_SSL. These two have been split from earlier simpler checks
         against LIBCURL_VERSION_NUM for ease of review.
     
         The CURLAUTH_DIGEST_IE flag was added in n 7.19.3[1], and
    -    CURLOPT_USE_SSL in 7.16.4[2], as noted in [2] it was then renamed from
    -    the older CURLOPT_FTP_SSL.
    +    CURLOPT_USE_SSL in 7.17.0[2][3], as noted in [2] it was then renamed
    +    from the older CURLOPT_FTP_SSL.
    +
    +    The documentation[2] currently claims that it was introduced in
    +    7.16.4, but the symbols-in-versions file correctly states
    +    7.17.0[3].
    +
    +    I've submitted an upstream
    +    patch (<patch-1.1-953bab490-20210730T170510Z-avarab@gmail.com>) to the
    +    curl-library mailing list fix the documentation.
