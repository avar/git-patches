Subject: [PATCH 0/2] fix v2.17.1 release notes & docs
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

I've pushed this as avar/post-v2.17.1-docs to the cabal repo:
https://github.com/git/cabal/compare/v2.17.1...avar/post-v2.17.1-docs

I think this or something like it makes sense for v2.17.1, as noted
the release notes are completely vague about how you should turn on
the .gitmodules protection, and we didn't add anything to the docs.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (2):
  config doc: don't describe *.fetchObjects twice
  v2.17.1: make the RelNotes understandable & update docs
