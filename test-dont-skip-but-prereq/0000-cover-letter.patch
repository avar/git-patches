Subject: [PATCH 0/4] Skip tests using 3-arg test_*
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This is a cleanup of the test code that I had on my TODO. We should be
using the 3-arg form of test_* instead of skip_all + test_done to skip
tests.

This doesn't cover all the cases that were using skip_all=*. The
remaining ones were too hairy to trivially convert, so I've left them
alone for now.

This also includes a documentation patch to t/README describing how
we'd like tests to be skipped.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (4):
  tests: implicitly skip SYMLINKS tests using <prereq>
  t/t5800-remote-helpers.sh: Skip with prereq on python <2.4
  t/t7800-difftool.sh: Skip with prereq on no PERL
  t/README: Update "Skipping tests" to align with best practices
