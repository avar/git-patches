I didn't notice Eric's E-mail before I sent my v3, so going back and
testing this revealed two things:

 1) Yes, his suggestion works
 2) AIX sed will complain about one thing at a time, so we had a lot
    more of these "labels too long" problems once I got past fixing
    that issue.

So here's a version, which as noted in 4/6 makes GIT_TEST_CHAIN_LINT=1
fully work on AIX again.

As an aside, the reason I have access to AIX is because I requested
access to the GCC compile farm as suggested by someone on-list here
the other day: https://cfarm.tetaneutral.net/

They accepted my account request on the basis that I was going to hack
on git & perl on those boxes, so if anyone else here is interested in
testing stuff for portability...

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (6):
  tests: fix and add lint for non-portable head -c N
  tests: fix and add lint for non-portable seq
  tests: fix comment syntax in chainlint.sed for AIX sed
  tests: use shorter here-docs in chainlint.sed for AIX sed
  tests: fix version-specific portability issue in Perl JSON
  tests: fix and add lint for non-portable grep --file
