Subject: [PATCH 18/31] hook: support passing stdin to hooks
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Some hooks (such as post-rewrite) need to take input via stdin.
Previously, callers provided stdin to hooks by setting
run-command.h:child_process.in, which takes a FD. Callers would open the
file in question themselves before calling run-command(). However, since
we will now need to seek to the front of the file and read it again for
every hook which runs, hook.h:run_command() takes a path and handles FD
management itself. Since this file is opened for read only, it should
not prevent later parallel execution support.

On the frontend, this is supported by asking for a file path, rather
than by reading stdin. Reading directly from stdin would involve caching
the entire stdin (to memory or to disk) and reading it back from the
beginning to each hook. We'd want to support cases like insufficient
memory or storage for the file. While this may prove useful later, for
now the path of least resistance is to just ask the user to make this
interim file themselves.
