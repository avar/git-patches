Subject: [PATCH v4 01/36] Makefile: mark "check" target as .PHONY
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Fix a bug in 44c9e8594e (Fix up header file dependencies and add
sparse checking rules, 2005-07-03), we never marked the phony "check"
target as such.

Perhaps we should just remove it, since as of a combination of
912f9980d2 (Makefile: help people who run 'make check' by mistake,
2008-11-11) 0bcd9ae85d (sparse: Fix errors due to missing
target-specific variables, 2011-04-21) we've been suggesting the user
run "make sparse" directly.

But under that mode it still does something, as well as directing the
user to run "make test" under non-sparse. So let's punt that and
narrowly fix the PHONY bug.
