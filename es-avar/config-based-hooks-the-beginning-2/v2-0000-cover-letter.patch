Subject: [PATCH v2 0/4] hook API: support stdin, convert post-rewrite
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

BEGIN UPDATE

I sent this v2 in already as [0]; but didn't fill in the
In-Reply-Header, consequently it was disconnected from the v1 thread,
and per https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqqr0v7o0pp.fsf@gitster.g/ (and
in "seen") hasn't been picked up. Sorry about that.

END UPDATE

As noted in the v1[1] this is the initial part of the greater
"config-based hooks" topic. I believe this iteration addresses all
comments on v1. Changes since then:

* Remove a couple of paragraphs in 1/4 that aren't relevant anymore,
  an already-landed topic addressed those.

* Don't needlessly change "cp->no_stdin = 1" and introduce an
  "else". This refactoring was there because that code eventually
  changes in the full "config-based hooks" topic, but going through
  those future changes I found that it wasn't for a good reason there
  either. We can just keep the "no_stdin = 1" by default, and have
  specific cases override that.

* Elaborate on why we're not converting the last "post-rewrite" hook
  here.

* Mention the future expected use for sendemail-validate in 5/5

The (passing) CI & topic branch for this is at[2].
