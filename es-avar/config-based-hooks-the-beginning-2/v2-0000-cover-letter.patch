Subject: [PATCH v2 0/5] hook API: support stdin, convert post-rewrite
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

As noted in the v1[1] this is the initial part of the greater
"config-based hooks" topic. I believe this iteration addresses all
comments on v1. Changes since then:

* Remove a couple of paragraphs in 1/4 that aren't relevant anymore,
  an already-landed topic addressed those.

* Don't needlessly change "cp->no_stdin = 1" and introduce an
  "else". This refactoring was there because that code eventually
  changes in the full "config-based hooks" topic, but going through
  those future changes I found that it wasn't for a good reason there
  either. We can just keep the "no_stdin = 1" by default, and have
  specific cases override that.

* Elaborate on why we're not converting the last "post-rewrite" hook
  here.

* Mention the future expected use for sendemail-validate in 5/5

The (passing) CI & topic branch for this is at[2].

Emily Shaffer (4):
  run-command: allow stdin for run_processes_parallel
  hook API: support passing stdin to hooks, convert am's 'post-rewrite'
  sequencer: use the new hook API for the simpler "post-rewrite" call
  hook: support a --to-stdin=<path> option

         Remove code that's been unused since it was added in
         c553c72eed6 (run-command: add an asynchronous parallel child
    -    processor, 2015-12-15), the next use of "i" in this function is:
    -
    -            for (i = 0; ...
    -
    -    So we'll always clobber the "i" that's set here. Presumably the "i"
    -    assignment is an artifact of WIP code that made it into our tree.
    -
    -    A subsequent commit will need to adjust the type of the "i" variable
    -    in the otherwise unrelated for-loop, which is why this is being
    -    removed now.
