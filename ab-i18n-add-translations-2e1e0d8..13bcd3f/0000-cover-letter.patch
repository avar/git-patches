The ab/i18n-gettextize series is now ready. And since I've tested it
with the new GETTEXT_POISON support I'm confident that it
works. Please pull it from:

    git://github.com/avar/git.git ab/i18n-gettextize

Web view:

Changes to the series since last time are this fixup patch:

This changed what was stored in commit messages, so it was *really*
breaking the plumbing. This was turned up with the new GETTEXT_POISON
debug support.

Then there are these two commits which are new in the series:

    7cd45c32 * gettextize: git-fetch split up "(non-fast-forward)" message
    8b47940b * gettextize: git-fetch update_local_ref messages

And finally (and attached) to make use of this all the
ab/i18n-add-translations series adds German and British English
Translations:

    git://github.com/avar/git.git ab/i18n-add-translations

Web view:

    http://github.com/avar/git/compare/ab/i18n-gettextize...ab/i18n-add-translations

1771 lines for the British English one to translate 3 strings is a bit
of an overkill. But it seems that projects that use gettext usually
include the untranslated strings too. E.g. glibc.git does that for its
en_GB.po file.

Maybe we can prune out entries with msgstr "". That seems to work on
GNU, it probably works on all other gettext implementations.

Note that these patches might not appear at all on the list, since
they might bump into the maximum message length on the list.
