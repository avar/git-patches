Subject: [PATCH v3 00/11] document & test fetch pruning & add fetch.pruneTags
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Addresses Junio's comments on v2 + more fixes. The 

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (11):
  fetch: don't redundantly NULL something calloc() gave us
  fetch: stop accessing "remote" variable indirectly

Moved these patches to the beginning. No changes except a note to the
commit message saying how these trivial changes relate (or not) to
subsequent changes.

  fetch tests: refactor in preparation for testing tag pruning

No changes.

  fetch tests: re-arrange arguments for future readability

s/arrange/re-arrange/ in commit message subject.

  fetch tests: add a tag to be deleted to the pruning tests

No changes.

  fetch tests: test --prune and refspec interaction

I'm now just skipping quoting things like +refs/... on the
command-line, which as grepping the rest of the test suite shows is
fine, this eliminated the need for "fetch tests: double quote a
variable for interpolation" so I've ejected it.

  git fetch doc: add a new section to explain the ins & outs of pruning

No changes.

  git remote doc: correct dangerous lies about what prune does

Rewording of doc per Junio's suggestion.


  git-fetch & config doc: link to the new PRUNING section

No changes.

  fetch tests: add scaffolding for the new fetch.pruneTags

No changes except continuing remove refspec quoting changes noted
above & using +refs/tags/... instead of refs/tags/... for consistency
with the last patch...

  fetch: add a --fetch-prune option and fetch.pruneTags config

We now consistently use a + prefixed refspec for tag pruning, even
though it yields the same result. See the discussion in
87tvvdh2vh.fsf@evledraar.gmail.com, I think it's less confusing.

Fix regex in --replace-all command in the commit message.

Rewording to address Junio's comments.

The short help for --prune-tags is now:

    -           N_("prune local tags not found on remote")),
    +           N_("prune local tags no longer on remote and clobber changed tags")),

Add --prune-tags to the bash completion.
