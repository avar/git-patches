Subject: [PATCH v4 0/9] ambiguous checkout UI & checkout.defaultRemote
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

v4 started as a simple bug-fix for this one-part series, but since
it's not going to make 2.18.0 at this point I thought I'd do some more
work on it. Comments on patches below:

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (9):
  checkout tests: index should be clean after dwim checkout

Tests that would have revealed the bug in v3.

  checkout.h: wrap the arguments to unique_tracking_name()
  checkout.[ch]: move struct declaration into *.h

Boring moving code around.

  checkout.[ch]: introduce an *_INIT macro

Make checkout.h have a TRACKING_NAME_DATA_INIT for its struct.

  checkout.[ch]: change "unique" member to "num_matches"
  checkout: pass the "num_matches" up to callers
  builtin/checkout.c: use "ret" variable for return

Refactoring with no changes yet to make subsequent changes smaller.

  checkout: add advice for ambiguous "checkout <branch>"

Even if checkout.defaultRemote is off we now print advice telling the
user why their "git checkout branch" didn't work.

  checkout & worktree: introduce checkout.defaultRemote

It's now called checkout.defaultRemote not checkout.implicitRemote on
Junio's suggestion. On reflection that's better.

Improved tests for git-worktree (similar to the dwim checkout tests
improvements earlier), and the the documentation for git-checkout &
git-worktree.

I'm omitting the tbdiff because most of it's because of the new
patches in this series. Better just to read them.
