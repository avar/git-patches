Subject: [PATCH 0/2] diffcore-pickaxe: implement --pickaxe-raw-diff
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This implements --pickaxe-raw-diff as explained in 2/2. I based this
on "next" because Duy's in-flight diff option refactoring would have
conflicted with it.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (2):
  diffcore-pickaxe: refactor !one or !two case in diff_grep
  diffcore-pickaxe: add --pickaxe-raw-diff for use with -G
