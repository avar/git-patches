Subject: [PATCH 0/3] tests: Better prerequisite handling & documentation
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

There were some useful nuggets in the "Tests in Cygwin" thread from
May last year that I've dug out and improved. This series adds support
for multiple test prerequisite, and improves the t/README
documentation by adding a "Prerequisites" section.

There's also a small fix to the raw test output.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (3):
  test-lib: Add support for multiple test prerequisites
  test-lib: Print missing prerequisites in test output
  t/README: Document the predefined test prerequisites
