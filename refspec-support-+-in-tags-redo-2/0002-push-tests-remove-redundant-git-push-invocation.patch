Subject: [PATCH v2 02/10] push tests: remove redundant 'git push' invocation
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Remove an invocation of 'git push' that's exactly the same as the one
on the preceding line. This was seemingly added by mistake in
dbfeddb12e ("push: require force for refs under refs/tags/",
2012-11-29) and doesn't affect the result of the test, the second
"push" was a no-op as there was nothing new to push.
