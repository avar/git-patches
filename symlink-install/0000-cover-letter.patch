Cool. I think it makes sense for us to have this. Here's an
implementation of it. The 3/3 patch looks a bit scary, but "git show"
with --word-diff will show that the change is minimal.

This steals a small piece from Daniel's relocatable series, and
doesn't in any way conflict with it. None of this will need to be
fixed up to make git relocatable since all the symlinks are relative
already.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (3):
  Makefile: fix broken bindir_relative variable
  Makefile: add a gitexecdir_relative variable
  Makefile: optionally symlink libexec/git-core binaries to bin/git
