Subject: [PATCH 0/3] enable userdiff for more things in git.git
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

A noticed that git.git doesn't have userdiff enabled for perl files,
and looking over some recent patches this gave better results, while
I'm at it add one for Python too. I couldn't find anything in
gitattributes(5) that was worth the bother of enabling this (e.g. we
just have one Ruby file).

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (3):
  .gitattributes: add *.pl extension for Perl
  .gitattributes: use the "perl" differ for Perl
  .gitattributes: add a diff driver for Python
