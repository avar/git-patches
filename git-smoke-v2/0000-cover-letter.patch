Subject: [PATCH/RFC v2 0/2] Smoke testing for Git
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This is v2 of the smoke testing RFC. It solves the TODO issues noted
in v1 of the RFC. There's now a smoke testing infrastructure for Git
at http://smoke.git.nix.is/, and this patch adds bits to git to
interoperate with it.

There's a lot more info in the first patch, and t/README documentation
in the second one.
