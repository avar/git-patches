         this will subtly fail in test-lib.sh. This has always been the case

         We'll just do the right thing because PERF_RESULTS_PREFIX will be
         empty, and test-lib.sh takes care of finding where our git is.
     
    -    Refactoring this revealed a few bugs, e.g. while a relative git path
    -    was supported via e.g.:
    +    Any refactoring of this code needs to change both the shell code and
    +    the Perl code in aggregate.perl, because when running e.g.:
     
             ./run ../../ -- <test>
     
    -    We'd just print out ".." as the header, since we'd always take the
    -    content after the last slash. Now we'll always resolve the absolute
    -    path to something we detect to be be a manually supplied bindir, and
    -    print the full path in the aggregation.
    +    The "../../" path to a relative bindir needs to be munged to a
    +    filename containing the results, and critically aggregate.perl does
    +    not get passed the path to those aggregations, just "../..".
     
    -    There was also a long-standing bug in the codespeed output where the
    -    "environment" for N number of tests would be whatever our
    -    GIT_TEST_INSTALLED had been set to by the last of those N runs. Let's
    -    instead just fall back to "uname -r", which is a more sensible
    -    "environment" than some random build directory path, even for the N=1
    -    case.
    +    Let's fix cases where aggregate.perl would print e.g. ".." in its
    +    report output for this, and "git" for "/home/avar/g/git", i.e. it
    +    would always pick the last element. Now'll always print the full path
    +    instead.
    +
    +    This also makes the code sturdier, e.g. you can feed "../.."  to
    +    "./run" and then an absolute path to the aggregate.perl script, as
    +    long as the absolute path and "../.." resolved to the same directory
    +    printing the aggregation will work.
     
         Also simplify the "[_*]" on the RHS of "tr -c", we're trimming
         everything to "_", so we don't need that.
