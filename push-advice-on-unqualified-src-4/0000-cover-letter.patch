Subject: [PATCH v4 0/7] fixes for unqualified <dst> push
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

I've finally re-rolled this. There wasn't consensus for the change to
add DWYM behavior to refs/remotes/*, so I've dropped it, 7/7 is still
there testing the current behavior of what we do with that now, since
we didn't have any tests for that.

This should address all feedback on v3, except I haven't reworded the
"this is what we do, even though you didn't do that now" message Junio
wasn't happy with in
https://public-inbox.org/git/xmqq8t2h5opm.fsf@gitster-ct.c.googlers.com/

I agree that the wording he was critiquing doesn't make sense at that
point in the series, but I think if you look over to 5/7 the final
state makes more sense. I.e. our message is of the form:

    Error, you tried to do X. Sometimes we DWYM, but only in cases:

    - A
    - B
    hint: Did you mean to do this thing that'll give you DWYM behavior
    like what we'd do for "B"?

I think in that case it makes sense to mention "B" in the message to
call out what exactly it is we DWYM on, why we didn't do it now, and
what you should do if that was what you meant. Not mentioning B would
be more confusing.

But maybe there's still disagreement on that and we can work out the
details of the wording, but now that a bunch of bugs have been fixed &
the controversial part ejected that'll be easier.
