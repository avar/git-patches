Subject: [PATCH 0/4] [PULL] ab/i18n-prereqs, prerequisites for ab/i18n
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

These are the first four patches in the ab/i18n series which aren't
strictly related to it, but merely fixes to issues I encountered.

I'm submitting these separately now in the hope that they'll make it
to the next & master branches before ab/i18n. Having these separately
reviewed should be easier for everyone.

These patches can also be fetched from:

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (4):
  Makefile: move "Platform specific tweaks" above LIB_{H,OBJS}
  t7004-tag.sh: re-arrange git tag comment for clarity
  tests: use test_cmp instead of piping to diff(1)
  builtin: use builtin.h for all builtin commands
