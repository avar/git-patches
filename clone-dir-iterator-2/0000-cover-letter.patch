Subject: [RFC PATCH v3 0/5] clone: dir iterator refactoring with tests
MIME-Version: 1.0

There's still active review going on for the "v2"[1], in particular
Duy's comments coming in as I write this. This doesn't address any of
that.

What it does do is have a better version of my patch to add tests for
the current behavior. It now doesn't reply the on SHA1 prereq anymore,
and we can test the dotfiles without needing the SYMLINK prereq.

I also moved it to the front of the series just to document/make sure
that we start by asserting testing functionality. I ran a full test
suite run for each of these patches and they all pass.

The only other change is getting rid of an unused "struct stat st"
variable which errored out under DEVELOPER=1.
