I think it's easier to clarify step-by-step with code, so here's an my
version of a v3 which implements what I was suggesting, but then of
course while doing it I found other stuff to fix, changes since your
v2:

René Scharfe (2):
  fsck: use strbuf_getline() to read skiplist file

None to the code.

I changed some docs I add in earlier patches to now describe behavior
in a past tense (and the s/sorted // change is earlier), and to change
the docs to say that sorting the list on-disk is now pointless for
optimization purposes, but did something in the past.

  fsck: use oidset for skiplist

There is now a test for the bug you were fixing in your 1/2.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (5):
  fsck tests: setup of bogus commit object

Fixing some test redundancies while I'm at it.

  fsck tests: add a test for no skipList input

We didn't test the most basic skipList invocation, fixed while I was
at it...

  fsck: document and test sorted skipList input

Test that sorted & unsorted skipList input, and document that in the
past we said this was required, but it never was, but what (ever so
slight) optimization this gives us.

  fsck: document and test commented & empty line skipList input

We don't support comments or empty lines. Add tests for this not
working, and explicitly document that it doesn't work (I for one tried
it).

  fsck: support comments & empty lines in skipList

Ignoring comments and empty lines is very useful for a file format
that might be human-edited (I maintain one such file). Support that,
and document & test for it.
