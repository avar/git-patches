Subject: [PATCH v3 2/7] fsck tests: add a test for no skipList input
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The recent 65a836fa6b ("fsck: add stress tests for fsck.skipList",
2018-07-27) added various stress tests for odd invocations of
fsck.skipList, but didn't tests for some very simple ones, such as
asserting that providing to skipList with a bad commit causes fsck to
exit with a non-zero exit code. Add such a test.
