Subject: [PATCH v2 0/6] grep: remove redundant code & reflags from API
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Addresses comments from Stefan Beller (thanks!). I looked into it and
the REG_NEWLINE flag was redundant in 1/2 cases, see 6/6 for the
removal of that.

I looked into refactoring 5/6 as noted in 87zicqirrg.fsf@gmail.com,
but for the reasons now explained in the last paragraph of 5/6 decided
not to and to keep it as it was.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (6):
  grep: remove redundant double assignment to 0
  grep: adjust a redundant grep pattern type assignment
  grep: remove redundant "fixed" field re-assignment to 0
  grep: remove redundant and verbose re-assignments to 0
  grep: remove regflags from the public grep_opt API
  grep: remove redundant REG_NEWLINE when compiling fixed regex
