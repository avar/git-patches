Subject: [PATCH 0/6] Detailed test coverage reports for Git
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Thomas Rast added initial test coverage support in 901c369af5. Expand
on that so that coverage is extended to C files in builtin/, xdiff/
and compat/.

In addition I've added support for formatting the coverage reports
with gcov2perl and Devel::Cover. Here's an example report formatted
with these tools:

    http://v.nix.is/~avar/cover_db_html/coverage.html

With it we can see that Git currently has 77.1% test coverage for its
core C code. It's also possible to dive in on a per-file basis,
e.g. here you can see how sparse the tests for git-blame's -L option
are, as I noted in a previous thread (and send partial patches):

    http://v.nix.is/~avar/cover_db_html/builtin-blame-c.html

I didn't yet look at how I could run the test suite so that we also
get test coverage for our core Perl code. Devel::Cover obviously
supports that, but it's just a matter of running the tests with the
right environmental variables, and merging the gcov + Devel::Cover
reports.

But that's a project for another day.
