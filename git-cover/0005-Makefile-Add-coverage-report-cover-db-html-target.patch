Subject: [PATCH 5/6] Makefile: Add coverage-report-cover-db-html target
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Add a target to generate a detailed HTML report for the entire Git
codebase using Devel::Cover's cover(1) tool. Output it in
cover_db_html instead of the default cover_db, so that it isn't mixed
up with our raw report files.

The target depends on the coverage-report-cover-db target, it may be
run redundantly if it was previously run. But the HTML output won't be
affected by running gcov2perl twice, so I didn't try to avoid that
small redundancy.
